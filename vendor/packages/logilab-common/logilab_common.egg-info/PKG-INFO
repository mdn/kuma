        What's this ?
        -------------
        
        This package contains some modules used by differents Logilab's
        projects.

        * handling command line options and configuration files
        * writing interactive command line tools
        * manipulation files and character strings
        * interfacing to OmniORB
        * generating SQL queries
        * running unit tests
        * manipulating tree structures
        * generating text and HTML reports
        * logging
        * parsing XML processing instructions
        * more...
        
        
        Installation
