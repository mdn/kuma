	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Only
	  delete start- and end elements in case 4 if they are not the same
	  element.

2009-08-03 15:30  friedelwolff

	* convert/dtd2po.py, tools/podebug.py: Give warnings for all
	  entities that are likely to contain CSS. Factor out and reuse in
	  podebug. This fixes bug 1093.

2009-08-03 14:18  arail

	* tools/podebug.py, tools/test_podebug.py: Use "%h" as a format
	  string for hashes, drop --hash=int parameter. Add some test
	  cases.

2009-07-31 15:23  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py, storage/placeables/general.py: Set
	  isfragile flags for placeables with base.X as a sub-class as well
	  as NewlinePlaceables.

2009-07-31 15:22  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/test_base.py: Updated tests to reflect recent
	  changes to StringElem.

2009-07-31 15:20  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Now
	  returns 3 values: the deleted string, the parent from which it
	  was deleted and the offset into the parent where the sub-string
	  was.

2009-07-31 15:19  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem: Added the "isfragile"
	  flag

2009-07-31 15:14  friedelwolff

	* doc/gen_api_docs.sh: Remove some debugging output

2009-07-31 14:29  friedelwolff

	* doc/epydoc-config.ini, doc/gen_api_docs.sh: Enable the script to
	  be run from outside its own directory. Don't specify the output
	  directory in the config, so that the script can specify it (since
	  it is better aware of where we are)

2009-07-31 14:12  friedelwolff

	* __version__.py: Version 1.4.0-rc2

2009-07-31 14:10  friedelwolff

	* doc/gen_api_docs.sh: Comment out the part that pushes the
	  documentation to SF - we don't want to do this each time

2009-07-31 13:27  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py,
	  storage/placeables/test_general.py: Recognise self closing tags.
	  +Tests for XMLTagPlaceable

2009-07-30 10:24  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py: Handle None targets in merge() just in case

2009-07-29 17:02  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add CapsPlaceable test

2009-07-29 16:54  dwaynebailey

	  classes in FilePlaceable test.

2009-07-29 16:48  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add a test for FilePlaceable

2009-07-29 16:26  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_xliff.py: Test that alt-trans doesn't interfere with
	  the real .target anymore

2009-07-29 16:20  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py: Correctly invalidate ._rich_source and
	  ._rich_target so that base.rich_* work correctly (since we don't
	  inherit .setsource and .settarget)

2009-07-29 16:08  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py: Disable rich string functionality for
	  poxliff. +TODO note.

2009-07-29 16:04  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Move

	* storage/placeables/test_base.py: Fix tests to reflect current
	  state of the toolkit.

2009-07-29 15:11  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py, storage/xliff.py: .getlanguageNodes() could
	  return results from alt-trans, which is not what we want. This
	  does the correct thing, might be slightly faster, but needed an
	  update for poxliff which depended on the old behaviour. Now we
	  match plurals based on id for extra goodness.

2009-07-29 15:09  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_xliff2po.py: Add an explicit id to the plural group
	  in the test as it should have. Upcoming code will depend on this.

2009-07-27 12:55  friedelwolff

	* storage/statsdb.py: Close the connection before unlinking the
	  file. This should fix bug 1068.

	* storage/test_xliff.py, storage/xliff.py: Put the (optional)
	  source before the target. This fixes bug 1072.

2009-07-24 18:49  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/__init__.py: Make list epydoc compliant

2009-07-24 16:22  dwaynebailey

2009-07-23 18:10  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py,
	  storage/placeables/test_general.py: Accept a word with two
	  initial capital letters as CamelCase. +Examples, +test

2009-07-23 14:15  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py: Use
	  translate.misc.xml_helpers.normalize_xml_space() in stead of
	  text_snippet() and tail_snippet().

2009-07-23 14:13  walter_l

	* misc/xml_helpers.py: Added normalize_xml_space(); replaces
	  text_snippet() and tail_snippet() from
	  translate.storage.placeables.lisa.

2009-07-22 15:45  arail

	* convert/moz2po.py, convert/po2moz.py: Don't convert HTML/XHTML
	  files used in Mozilla. (Closes: #1061)

2009-07-22 15:34  friedelwolff

	* lang/de.py: Initial support for German (de). For now this just
	  disables the simplecaps test.

	* storage/qph.py, storage/tbx.py, storage/tmx.py,
	  storage/wordfast.py, storage/xliff.py: Align the names of the

2009-07-22 15:19  friedelwolff

	* misc/xml_helpers.py, storage/placeables/lisa.py,
	  storage/placeables/test_lisa.py, storage/xliff.py: Support
	  xml:space correctly for XLIFF placeables. Some sane values are
	  guessed for the default behaviour. This is the last major
	  outstanding piece of bug 1017.

2009-07-22 15:05  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Correctly remove
	  variables before accelerators in unchanged(). +Test

2009-07-22 13:59  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Check more thoroughly
	  for unchanged strings. We were not catching multi-word unchanged
	  strings. This fixes bug 1059, although more thought might be
	  needed in this area. [Contributed by Rail Aliev]

2009-07-21 16:07  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2php.py: Decode the line before processing. This fixes

	* storage/xml_extract/misc.py: Clean up copyright header,
	  whitespace

2009-07-20 01:59  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py, storage/tmdb.py: properly quote and unquote
	  source strings in urls.
	  
	  log results when in debug mode.
	  
	  this should finally fix #991 however virtaal fails to display
	  some results despite tmserver returning them.

2009-07-19 23:59  alaaosh

	* search/indexing/PyLuceneIndexer.py: tabs vs spaces cute, real
	  cute

2009-07-19 02:56  alaaosh

	  max-length options

2009-07-19 02:55  alaaosh

	* search/indexing/PyLuceneIndexer.py: disable file locking
	  
	  assumption is lucene is taking care of locking for us, needs more
	  testing and verification

2009-07-18 09:46  friedelwolff

	* storage/properties.py: Support multiline comments better

2009-07-18 09:44  friedelwolff

	* CREDITS: Credit Rail and Grégory

2009-07-18 09:06  friedelwolff

	* convert/prop2mozfunny.py: Now that properties' comments are
	  stored without newlines, we have to generate lines for .it files
	  with newlines attached to comments. This fixes the issue with
	  .ini files in bug 1053. [Reported by Rail Aliev].

2009-07-17 16:34  friedelwolff

	* filters/spelling.py: Some versions of enchant don't raise
	  DictNotFoundError as it should, so we rather check some text that
	  might trigger a general enchant exception

2009-07-17 10:56  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py: Save the XML attributes for
	  placeables created from XML nodes.

	  This fixes bug 1044.

2009-07-16 14:15  friedelwolff

	* storage/properties.py: Don'e escape controls on comment lines,
	  they are escaped enough. This fixes a regression since toolkit

2009-07-16 14:12  friedelwolff

	* storage/poparser.py: Don't try and get too fancy with guessing
	  escaped quotes on line end. These are considered invalid by

	  initialising from a skeleton

2009-07-15 08:19  friedelwolff

	  remove single-line 'if' statements

2009-07-02 11:52  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py: Bx and Ex classes should ignore extra

2009-07-02 11:52  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py: Added support for converting between

	  merge sibling StringElem leaves.

2009-06-25 13:01  friedelwolff

	  placeables. Should reconsider later.

2009-06-23 15:58  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.insert(): Simplify case
	  2 to be equivalent to be only case 2.2, ie. always insert _after_

	* convert/xliff2po.py: Cleaner API use for locations

2009-06-22 13:05  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Let each matcher specify the sorting direction
	  to ensure that all sorting can be correct. This solves the issue
	  with newer, longer terms added in Virtaal not being recognised
	  since the shorter ones are matched first.

2009-06-22 12:09  friedelwolff

	* convert/prop2po.py, misc/quote.py, storage/properties.py: Several
	  small updates relating to encoding, notably for non-ascii latin1

	  properties classes and use that to support java properties
	  encoded in latin1

2009-06-18 02:04  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: double unquoting was causing problems, no
	  need for plus unquoting since tmdb now strips away non
	  alphanumeric charachters anyway
	  
	  fixes #991

2009-06-18 02:03  alaaosh

	* storage/tmdb.py: cleanup unitwords before attempting fulltext
	  indexing
	  
	  note that fulltext indexer has it's own set of quoting problems
	  that dbapi2's automagic escaping won't avoid
	  
	  we should look into stop words and normalization one day
	  
	  fixes #989

2009-06-17 21:05  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add TODO for Placeable test
	  that are missing

2009-06-17 20:56  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add the OptionPlaceable tests

2009-06-17 20:51  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add XML Entity Placeable
	  tests

2009-06-17 20:47  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add PunctuationPlaceable
	  tests

2009-06-17 20:37  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add test for SpacesPlaceable

2009-06-17 20:31  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add CamelCasePlaceable tests

2009-06-17 20:13  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add tests for Qt Formatted
	  variables.

2009-06-17 20:09  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add tests the show different
	  decimal and group seperators: point, comma and non-breaking space

2009-06-17 20:03  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add test for Alt Attr
	  placeable

2009-06-17 19:56  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add test for newline

2009-06-17 19:52  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py,
	  storage/placeables/test_general.py: Add tests for placeables.
	  Improve number placeable to allow for a preceding sign +/-

2009-06-17 19:38  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_base.py: Assign some parsers so we can have some
	  rich structure to test with

2009-06-17 15:15  friedelwolff

	* convert/odf2xliff.py, convert/xliff2odf.py: Since
	  convertoptionsparser already opens the files for us, it is not
	  opened in binary, and we get errors on Windows. So let's reopen
	  it ourselves. This should re-fix bug 816.

2009-06-17 15:11  friedelwolff

	* storage/odf_io.py: No need to open the file in binary mode - the
	  library will do it for us (as long as the file isn't already
	  open)

2009-06-17 15:06  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py, storage/xliff.py: Move rich string handling from
	  lisa to xliff while it is the only format for which we support it

2009-06-17 14:01  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py: Clean up whitespace and copyright header. No
	  functional change.

2009-06-17 13:53  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py, storage/test_xliff.py, storage/tmx.py,
	  storage/xliff.py: An attempt at a more interoperable
	  implementation of the handling of xml:space, with particular aim
	  at interoperability with XLIFF files that don't use
	  xml:space="preserve". This is likely a bit of a performance hit -
	  need to see how badly we regress on large files.

2009-06-17 12:19  dwaynebailey

	* README: Layout and spelling fixes

2009-06-17 11:07  friedelwolff

	* storage/subtitles.py: Update copyright dates, cleanup whitespace
	  and unused import. No functional change.

2009-06-17 11:05  friedelwolff

	* misc/multistring.py: Fix DeprecationWarning in Python 2.6 about
	  'object.__init__() takes no parameters'

2009-06-16 08:45  friedelwolff

	* tools/podebug.py: Don't ignore CapsPlaceable and
	  CamelCasePlaceable in podebug - we want to translate these as
	  well

2009-06-16 06:54  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py, tools/test_podebug.py: Add a bracket podebug
	  rewrite style. Which will surround strings with [ and ]

2009-06-15 20:51  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Rewrite temporary file handling to work on
	  Windows. We can't use the output of NamedTemporaryFile while it
	  is still open, otherwise we get an access violation on Windows.

2009-06-15 13:21  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: First test for a usable type before we do in
	  detail __eq__ on a unit

2009-06-15 13:20  dwaynebailey

	* CREDITS: Credit Ivan Masár for the pocount improvements

2009-06-15 13:18  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pocount.py: Add patches from bug 825 that adds:
	  - --short-words, --short-strings (more compact output)
	  - --incomplete (only count incomplete files)

2009-06-15 13:07  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: Ensure we initialise ._rich_source and
	  ._rich_target if we bypass the constructor. This fixes bug 994.

2009-06-15 11:10  dwaynebailey

	* convert/prop2po.py: Default to using Java personality throughout
	  prop2po

2009-06-15 11:07  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_prop2po.py: Add --personality commandline options to
	  the --help test.

2009-06-15 11:02  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Temporarily disable the startcaps->simplecaps
	  precondition, since it is causing lots of false positives since
	  Python 2.6.

2009-06-15 10:57  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Finally move to Python 2.4 APIs for more
	  efficient sorting. This breaks compatibility with Python 2.3, but
	  gives a nice speedup with later versions.

2009-06-15 10:38  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Align nso name with ISO639

2009-06-15 10:35  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Work correctly with string
	  elements that will all be unicode strings. This only affects
	  debug code.

2009-06-15 10:33  friedelwolff

	* tools/pretranslate.py: Use the defaul gettext migration strategy
	  if no location comments exist. The Mozilla and OOo matching will
	  now only happen for units with locations not containing a colon
	  (:)

2009-06-13 20:46  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/parse.py: Don't just prune the last leaf after
	  the for loop - do it inside for each

2009-06-13 17:07  dwaynebailey

	* convert/moz2po.py, convert/prop2po.py: Add ability to give
	  prop2po a personality: Java or Mozilla.
	  Doesn't do much at the moment, just adds the X-Accelerator header
	  if
	  called with --personality=mozilla. Adapted moz2po to do the right
	  thing.
	  This should allow us to handle Latin1 vs UTF-8 in the future.

2009-06-13 15:44  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Implement a format matcher for Qt
	  variables (should also work for KDE4).

2009-06-13 08:57  friedelwolff

	* tools/podebug.py: Fix typo/thinko

2009-06-12 14:41  friedelwolff

	* storage/properties.py: Use '=' as the default delimiter for
	  properties files

2009-06-12 14:41  friedelwolff

	* storage/properties.py: Correct calculation of starting position
	  of significant line content

2009-06-12 14:38  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_properties.py: Test for support for property with
	  zero-length key

2009-06-12 13:39  friedelwolff

	* misc/quote.py: Escape the slash character when outputting to
	  properties

2009-06-12 13:29  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py, storage/pypo.py: Fix a minor bug that might have
	  caused us to not have headers in the output of oo2po and similar
	  tools

2009-06-12 12:55  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: Provide a location comment in the
	  test_migrate_msgidcomment_to_msgctxt() test - which realistically
	  is what upcoming mozilla translations will need to work with
	  migrating from msgid comments to msgctxct

2009-06-12 10:50  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Better link to the Python string
	  formatting documentation

2009-06-12 08:33  friedelwolff

	* convert/symb2po.py: -syntax error. -unused imports

2009-06-12 07:31  dwaynebailey

	* storage: Ignore *.class

2009-06-12 07:26  dwaynebailey

	* storage/debug.properties: Add a simple example debug.properties
	  file

2009-06-12 07:18  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.java: Add a Java .properties file testing
	  program

2009-06-12 06:30  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py, storage/test_poheader.py: Update the test to
	  be time independent, and make sure we always end a contributor
	  line with a fullstop.

2009-06-12 06:23  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py, storage/test_poheader.py: Extend the test to
	  test for correct handling of full stop in a contributor line.
	  This closes the reopened bug 985.

2009-06-11 21:26  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py, storage/test_poheader.py: Test for updating
	  copyright comments in the header, and fix a case that wasn't
	  handled correctly. This fixes bug 985.

2009-06-11 15:09  dwaynebailey

	* storage/pypo.py: Ensure we escape values that we put into msgctxt

2009-06-11 13:40  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py: We shouldn't strip space from the
	  beginnging of a value since if it got in its significant.

2009-06-11 13:38  dwaynebailey

	* misc/quote.py: Reduce escapes to the ones supported by
	  .properties files: fnrt
	  Drop all other backslashes

2009-06-11 13:13  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_prop2po.py, storage/properties.py,
	  storage/test_properties.py: Implement proper .properties
	  whitespace handling. Add fn key_strip
	  to strip and handle whitespace in the key. Remove strippig
	  functionality
	  from 'value'. Adjust tests as needed.

2009-06-11 12:48  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py, storage/test_properties.py: Allow # or !
	  for comments. Add tests to test for the different types.

2009-06-11 12:32  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py, storage/test_properties.py: Add
	  is_line_continuation function to do the correct thing with line
	  continuation characters.
	  Use the function in the parser.

2009-06-11 12:00  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py, storage/test_properties.py: Use
	  find_delimeter instead of the simple check for "=" to
	  seperate key from value. Add test to check the three variants.

2009-06-11 11:53  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py, storage/test_properties.py: Add
	  find_delimeter function and tests. We can now find the delimeter:
	  =, : or space in a properties line.

2009-06-11 11:41  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Reflow some lines for better
	  readability

2009-06-11 07:33  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: [port of r11488 to cpo] if the source or the
	  context change, merging should cause the unit to go fuzzy

2009-06-11 06:54  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py: if the source or the context change, merging
	  should cause the unit to go fuzzy

2009-06-11 06:52  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: +some tests to verify correct merging
	  behaviour with changing contexts, empty msgid with
	  context/msgidcomments, etc.

2009-06-11 06:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py: Test for the presence of any context to
	  determine of the unit should generate output

2009-06-11 06:43  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_po.py: Test more for correct handling of context
	  only units

2009-06-10 14:44  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py, storage/pypo.py, storage/test_po.py: Mark
	  messages with no source but having msgctxt as translatable. +test

2009-06-10 14:41  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_po.py: Use quoting functions from pypo where they
	  belong. Don't assume multistrings for singular units.

2009-06-10 14:30  friedelwolff

	* tools/podebug.py: Carefully only apply transformation functions
	  to translatable string elements. Now podebug should be far, far
	  more useful for debugging things containing XML, variables, etc.

2009-06-10 14:29  friedelwolff

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Test that we leave variables alone in the
	  unicode transformation

2009-06-10 13:53  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: We should go fuzzy if context changed in
	  the pot file. Change tests to reflect that.

2009-06-10 13:34  friedelwolff

	* tools/pretranslate.py: Follow different matching strategies for
	  different PO files: standard gettext files, vs. files generated
	  with moz2po and oo2po. This fixes bug 982.

2009-06-10 13:00  alaaosh

	* storage/subtitles.py: use utf-8 whenever you detect ascii
	  encoding.
	  
	  this still doesn't solve the problem of input encoding being
	  totally different from template encoding when converting.

2009-06-10 12:57  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Add Java MessageFormat placeable

2009-06-10 12:33  alaaosh

	* convert/po2sub.py: put source text if no target is found
	  (untranslated or fuzzy units)

2009-06-10 11:45  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py, convert/test_prop2po.py: Test
	  specifically for the presence of msgctxt in the output in the
	  case of empty source strings

2009-06-10 11:17  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2csv.py: Don't use assume a multistring and .strings
	  unless we know it is a plural unit

2009-06-10 11:14  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Don't convert to string without encoding
	  - doesn't work for non-ascii anyway

2009-06-10 11:10  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: [port r11457 to cpo] Get rid of 'msgid_comment',
	  'msgid_comment_all' and 'keep' merging styles for removing
	  duplicates.

2009-06-10 10:51  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py: Get rid of 'msgid_comment', 'msgid_comment_all'
	  and 'keep' merging styles for removing duplicates. Call me
	  'Killer'.

2009-06-10 10:46  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_pypo.py: Remove tests for 'msgid_comment' and 'keep'
	  merge styles

2009-06-10 09:33  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/test_lisa.py: Make all literals unicode
	  strings - this way the API doesn't need to accept them silently
	  and hide errors

2009-06-10 09:26  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py: Add link to Java MessageFormat
	  documentation

2009-06-10 09:19  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py: Fix ref to external documentation

2009-06-09 15:30  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Case 3
	  didn't work as expected for simple strings (no placeables).

2009-06-09 15:29  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): More
	  descriptive comments

2009-06-09 13:04  alaaosh

	* storage/subtitles.py: encoding conversion doesn't work properly,
	  disable for now.

2009-06-09 13:03  alaaosh

	* storage/subtitles.py: don't use spaces when converting timestamps
	  to locations

2009-06-09 12:55  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.__init__(): Don't
	  accept str children, only unicode.

2009-06-09 12:53  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Provide
	  index information on IndexErrors.

2009-06-08 16:28  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_xliff2po.py: Adapt tests to the fact that we handle
	  xml:preserve correctly, and test for both 'preserve' and the
	  default

2009-06-08 16:21  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_convert.py: Only do psyco handling in the test if it
	  is installed

2009-06-08 15:57  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Don't handle fuzzy as a typecomment -
	  libgettextpo doesn't, so we need to handle fuzzy as a separate
	  attribute. Let's break out early while searching for a type
	  comment as a cheap shot at optimisation.

2009-06-08 15:36  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py: Rather use .istranslatable() in store.isempty()
	  since it is really what we mean. This will allow formats to
	  override this in a more meaninful way.

2009-06-08 15:34  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py: multistring_to_rich() should not be a
	  classmethod - this way we can set parsers for each instance as we
	  need

2009-06-08 15:22  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_xliff.py: Only use unicode literals for strings - we
	  don't want the api to accept the rest anyway

2009-06-08 14:30  friedelwolff

	* search/test_match.py: Adapt test to take into account that we
	  work with lower case strings in matching, and therfore also in
	  the resulting source we get back

2009-06-08 14:26  friedelwolff

	* search/test_match.py, search/test_terminology.py: Move
	  terminology changes to test_match, since the code they are
	  testing moved there. Rewrite to reflect the change.

2009-06-08 14:17  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Sort by length before appending alternate forms.
	  This way the alternate forms will always have lower priority

2009-06-08 14:15  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Ensure that at least one space or hyphen exists
	  before substituting

2009-06-08 13:21  friedelwolff

	* tools/podebug.py: Handle all literals as unicode strings

2009-06-08 13:13  friedelwolff

	* tools/podebug.py: Rather use unit.istranslatable() than trying to
	  guess what is needed

2009-06-08 13:11  friedelwolff

	* tools/podebug.py: Generate rich strings for formats that don't
	  support them, and use that to avoid changing XML, variables, etc.

2009-06-08 12:39  friedelwolff

	* tools/test_podebug.py: only use unicodes in testing - we don't
	  want to support working with str

2009-06-08 11:17  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Prune the element after creation
	  to ensure it is in the correct presentation. This should simplify
	  tests a bit.

2009-06-08 11:10  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: set xml:space properly for new units we create
	  as well as alttrans units

2009-06-08 11:02  friedelwolff

	* storage/pocommon.py: Search for the end of msgid comments in a
	  non-greedy way

2009-06-08 11:02  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_base.py: Remove unused import

2009-06-08 10:42  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_base.py: We don't want parsing to work for
	  non-unicode strings, so let's not test for it

2009-06-08 07:56  friedelwolff

	* storage/tmx.py: Clean up whitespace and license header. No
	  functional change

2009-06-08 07:47  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: Correctly handle xml:space attributes, whereever
	  they might have been specified up in the xml tree. This might be
	  a bit of a performance hit, but this gives us long awaited
	  correct handling of whitespace in XLIFF, etc.

2009-06-08 07:45  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_xliff.py: Test for the correct handling of xml:space
	  attributes

2009-06-08 07:21  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Clean up whitespace and license header. No
	  functional change

2009-06-08 07:15  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py: Clean up whitespace and license header. No
	  functional change

2009-06-08 07:09  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Impliment a first version of buildfromunit() that
	  can actually usefully instantiate itself from a another pounit

2009-06-08 07:07  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Always decode the strings obtained from
	  libgettextpo instead of relying on autoencode through
	  multistring. Minor optimisations by using unicodes where
	  multistrings are not necessary

2009-06-08 07:02  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Use pocommon.extract_msgid_comment() instead of
	  custom code

2009-06-08 07:00  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Use setmsgidcomment() as a setter for the
	  msgidcomment property

2009-06-08 06:58  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Impliment settypecomment() and give proper
	  argtypes for +gpo.po_message_is_format()

2009-06-08 06:54  friedelwolff

	* storage/pocommon.py: Provide a central method for extracting
	  msgid comments

2009-06-08 06:50  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Mark some placeable types as
	  untranslatable for when we want to use this information

2009-06-05 15:47  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.insert(): Prune the
	  element in which the insert happened.

2009-06-05 14:06  friedelwolff

	* services/tmserver.py: Typo in docstring

2009-06-03 15:45  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Better regular expression for
	  UrlPlaceable. Now we support full URLs with trailing paths.

2009-06-03 14:49  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Fix docstring

2009-06-03 12:30  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Placeable for fancy spaces -
	  currently unused

2009-06-03 12:07  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py, search/terminology.py: Rewrite the terminology
	  matcher to do more processing during initialisation to speed up
	  matching, especially in the face of alternatives. More todo in
	  this area.

2009-06-03 10:02  friedelwolff

	* services/tmserver.py: Only use logging on level WARNING by
	  default, this way normal operation shouldn't give much output

2009-06-03 10:00  friedelwolff

	* services/tmserver.py: Cosmetic changes: docstrings, wrapping,
	  spacing, unused import

2009-06-03 04:36  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2symb.py, convert/symb2po.py, tools/build_tmdb.py:
	  s/Virtaal/Translate Toolkit/

2009-06-03 04:32  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py: s/Virtaal/Translate Toolkit/

2009-06-02 21:41  friedelwolff

	* storage/php.py: Cosmetic changes to comments, docstrings. Update
	  copyright header. No functional change.

2009-06-02 21:39  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2php.py, convert/test_po2php.py: A broken testcase and
	  a fix

2009-06-02 16:29  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Add nbsp as a delimter

2009-06-02 16:28  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Allow multiple groups not just
	  decimal seperator

2009-06-01 16:06  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Small cosmetic (comment) change.

2009-06-01 16:05  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Delete
	  the whole start- or end element if necessary.

2009-06-01 16:03  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Remove
	  unused delete_nodes list.

2009-06-01 16:02  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): (Case
	  4) Find the indexes of the start and end nodes by identity and
	  not value (ie. don't use list.index).

2009-06-01 16:01  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_elem(): Remove
	  the element based on identity and not (equal) value.

2009-06-01 15:51  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Never use units with single character source
	  strings for TM. This handles the issue where we were getting
	  '100% matches' for disassociated accesskeys in Mozilla
	  translations in new units when using a compendium.

2009-06-01 15:45  friedelwolff

	* search/terminology.py: Minor optimisation of existing terminology
	  matching algorythm

2009-05-28 05:55  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Add a FIXME for the punctuation
	  placeable.

2009-05-28 05:53  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Use \B to ensure that we have
	  space before the dashes. Prevents word--word from being selected.

2009-05-28 05:04  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Add an Options placeable for
	  --help, -h, -I

2009-05-27 16:25  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.insert(): Return True
	  if the insert was completed successfully, False otherwise.

2009-05-27 16:24  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.insert(): Added
	  (commented out) debugging messages.

2009-05-27 16:24  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.prune(): Collapse
	  leaves' children into a single string.

2009-05-27 16:23  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.prune(): Convert stray
	  unicode or str nodes in the tree to StringElem leaves.

2009-05-27 16:22  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range():
	  list.remove() finds the element to remove via __eq__. This means
	  that if two placeables that look the same are present, the first
	  one will always be removed before the second.

2009-05-27 14:12  dwaynebailey

	* filters/autocorrect.py: Fix terminology msgid->source
	  msgstr->target

2009-05-27 13:57  dwaynebailey

	* filters/autocorrect.py: Update header. Add more detailed
	  docstrings

2009-05-27 13:52  dwaynebailey

	* filters/autocorrect.py: Allow ellipses to be corrected in either
	  direction i.e. to follow the pattern of the source text.

2009-05-26 15:12  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: New regular expression for
	  CamelCase placeable that doesn't match all uppercase strings

2009-05-26 10:36  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.insert(): Improvements
	  to avoid inserting unnecessary new leaves.

2009-05-26 10:09  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.translate(): Return a
	  copy of the current tree by default.

2009-05-26 10:08  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.insert(): Use a
	  StringElem in stead of a normal string.

2009-05-26 10:07  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: + NewlinePlaceable

2009-05-25 10:38  friedelwolff

	* filters/test_checks.py: Test for an accelerated hyphen (-) as
	  spotted in Firefox

2009-05-25 10:36  friedelwolff

	* filters/decoration.py: Allow hyphen (-) and question mark (?) as
	  accelerators, since it does actually occur in the wild

2009-05-25 10:33  friedelwolff

	* lang/test_common.py: Further test for sentece segmentation

2009-05-25 10:31  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Move the number placeable to the
	  lowest priority. This ensures that a term such as 'MP3' is
	  matched as a caps placeable. This should also avoid matching
	  numbers inside URLs, e-mail addresses, format specifiers, etc.

2009-05-25 10:29  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Escape the '-' in the regular
	  expression. We now correctly match a term such as 'D-BUS' as a
	  caps placeable

2009-05-25 10:24  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/terminology.py: Remove duplicate translations
	  for terminology placeable

2009-05-25 10:22  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/terminology.py: Find all terminology matches
	  for the current placeable by comparing positions and lengths,
	  since term_string could look different to m.source due to case
	  changes, hyphenation, or other morphological changes

2009-05-25 10:14  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: Some helper methods that we might need in
	  future, license updates, typo, TODO, etc. No functional change.

2009-05-22 09:17  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem: Added remove_type()
	  method. It replaces elements of the given types with StringElem
	  nodes.

2009-05-22 09:16  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Documented return value.

2009-05-22 09:15  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Fixed
	  returns.

2009-05-21 13:36  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Add some other exotic characters
	  found in the Translate.org.za corpus of translations. Including
	  em dash, en dash and those three dots whose name I always forget

2009-05-20 14:40  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Only recognise unusual punctuation
	  marks as placeables

2009-05-20 14:37  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Hopefully more accurate CamelCase
	  placeable

2009-05-20 14:24  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.prune(): Added
	  optimisation: "# Symbolically: StringElem->StringElem2->(leaves)
	  => StringElem->(leaves)"

2009-05-20 14:23  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.prune(): Also remove
	  empty strings (as apposed to StringElems only).

2009-05-20 14:21  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): In
	  stead of returning the deleted sub-string, return a StringElem
	  including the parent that contained it (None for root).

2009-05-19 11:22  alaaosh

	* storage/base.py: add useful methods for interacting with source
	  index

2009-05-19 08:31  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Remove misplaced dash (-) in regex

2009-05-18 17:08  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range(): Added
	  nice (commented out) debugging output: "foo[bar]baz" if "bar" is
	  to be deleted from "foobarbaz".

2009-05-18 17:07  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/parse.py: The important parse() function no
	  longer accepts plain strings as arguments.

2009-05-18 13:57  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Remove TODO - we are now checking
	  better for TLDs

2009-05-18 13:16  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Improvement to the email
	  detection. Has some intellegence to ensure that emails have a TLD
	  of some sort.

2009-05-18 12:00  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py: Partially revert r11124 - we need the header
	  at the start of .units. More work needed here.

2009-05-18 11:46  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Fix spacing as per PEP8.

2009-05-18 10:15  friedelwolff

	* README: Partially revert r11129 - we do still depend on iniparse

2009-05-18 09:26  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Also handle numeric entities, and
	  ensure that we look for XML entities before numbers.

2009-05-18 08:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Regex for XML entity is already
	  non-greedy. Instead of allowing all non-space characters in the
	  name (\S) we should match a much smaller set - valid SGML names.

2009-05-18 07:44  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Rewrite FilePaceable regex as a
	  raw string, and demand at least three characters in filename.
	  +Some notes.

2009-05-18 07:39  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Important TODOs with existing
	  regular expressions. We need to have this perfect :-)

2009-05-18 07:33  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: +CamelCasePlaceble

2009-05-18 07:31  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/general.py: +CapsPlaceable

2009-05-18 07:27  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Translate the
	  punctuation before checking endwhitespace. This gives opportunity
	  to remove trailing spaces in languages using fullwidth
	  punctuation without extra spacing. Test with Chinese example.

2009-05-18 07:23  friedelwolff

	* README: Remove the obsolete note of requiring iniparse. Other
	  minor typos.

2009-05-18 07:21  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: Fix typos for Piemontese and Pashto: nplurals 1->2

2009-05-18 07:20  friedelwolff

	* lang/common.py, lang/test_zh.py: Fix a bug where a single
	  character string like '.' will be transformed (for example in
	  Chinese), and we want to test for the second last character. Add
	  a test for this case in Chinese.

2009-05-18 07:14  friedelwolff

	* storage/statsdb.py: Be extra careful with the rollback to see if
	  we even have a connection. This hopefully fixes bug 832.

2009-05-18 07:12  friedelwolff

	* storage/ini.py: Fix license block, whitespace, copyright dates

2009-05-18 07:07  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py: Fix .updateheader() to use .addunit().
	  Should now work for POXLIFF.

2009-05-18 07:04  friedelwolff

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Basic test for flipped rewrite style

2009-05-18 06:49  friedelwolff

	* tools/podebug.py: New rewrite style: flipped

2009-05-16 21:29  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Limit the number of spelling suggestions to 5
	  in the case where something like aspell gives back 20

2009-05-16 21:20  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Don't strip accelerators and variables when
	  checking whitespace

2009-05-16 21:19  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Also check fancy (curly) quotation marks in
	  the doublequoting check

2009-05-16 12:42  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/parse.py: If a leaf is not editable, don't
	  bother to look for further placeables inside

2009-05-16 12:41  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/parse.py: only force the leaf to unicode once,
	  in case it is expensive

2009-05-16 12:29  friedelwolff

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: typo in docstring

2009-05-16 11:02  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: +Piemontese (pms)

2009-05-16 05:47  dwaynebailey

	* convert/odfxml: Catch a corner case of files with spaces that
	  aren't escaped.

2009-05-15 08:51  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Doh! Don't match empty strings as
	  numbers.

2009-05-15 08:50  walter_l

	* storage/base.py: Use an empty list as the default list of
	  placeables parsers to use in TranslateUnit.

2009-05-14 15:19  friedelwolff

	* convert/pot2po.py: Call _prepare_merge before we instantiate the
	  fuzzy matchers - otherwise resurrecting obsolete entries has no
	  effect. This (with previous commits) fixes bug 928.

2009-05-14 15:18  friedelwolff

	* tools/pretranslate.py: Don't match on 100% if location comments
	  differ - the matchers will do that. We'll need to work out when
	  to use locations and when to use the gettext IDs. (part of fixing
	  bug 928)

2009-05-14 15:15  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: Test units with small source strings are
	  not incorrectly populated by means of fuzzy matching

2009-05-14 13:36  friedelwolff

	* convert/pot2po.py: Clean up docstrings, typos, whitespace

2009-05-14 13:24  friedelwolff

	* tools/pretranslate.py: Clean up docstrings, typos, whitespace

2009-05-14 13:22  friedelwolff

	* tools/pretranslate.py: Clean up docstrings, typos, whitespace

2009-05-14 12:29  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: + NumberPlaceable,
	  PythonFormattingPlaceable: Thanks, Dwayne. :)

2009-05-14 02:19  alaaosh

	* tools/pretranslate.py: oops still unfamiliar with api, I blame
	  home affairs.
	  
	  istranslated returns False for fuzzies, is gettargetlen() to test
	  for existence of target instead

2009-05-14 01:49  alaaosh

	* tools/pretranslate.py: replace test for target length, with
	  unit.istranslated
	  
	  code written before I got familiar with API

2009-05-14 01:48  alaaosh

	* storage/statsdb.py: add ability to pass store as callback in
	  statsdb. callback returns a TranslationStore.
	  
	  in pootle this allows Store stats to be accessed without
	  unnecessary parsing file,
	  at the same time if statsdb needs to parse the file it is still
	  stored in pootle's storecache

2009-05-13 19:03  dwaynebailey

	* lang/identify.py: Language identification module that uses
	  libtextcat

2009-05-11 13:51  friedelwolff

	* tools/pomerge.py: Mention default value for --mergeblanks and
	  --mergecomments. Part of addressing bug 953.

2009-05-08 16:19  alaaosh

	* storage/versioncontrol/__init__.py: RCS detection b0rked for
	  dirs.
	  search for metadir as sibling when testing files and as child
	  when testing directories

2009-05-07 21:39  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py: Minor cleanups in docstrings

2009-05-07 15:15  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2dtd.py: Update comment to reflect newest changes

2009-05-07 14:02  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2dtd.py, convert/test_po2dtd.py: Only change the case
	  of the accesskey if the translation is unchanged from the source
	  text, otherwise keep it exactly as we obtain it from the
	  translation. This fixes some rare cases where generated
	  accesskeys might have shifted between upper/lower case variants
	  during po2dtd.

2009-05-07 10:38  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_po2dtd.py: Add TODO note to test_accesskeycase

2009-05-07 10:33  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_po2html.py: Mask out unimportant tests that are
	  unlikely to get any attention soon

2009-05-07 10:03  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py: Mark .changeencoding() as deprecated. No users
	  left.

2009-05-07 09:58  friedelwolff

	* convert/symb2po.py: Remove last call in the toolkit to
	  postore.changeencoding(). We probably want something in poheader
	  to rather do this, or alter the behaviour of .updateheader().

2009-05-07 09:45  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py: White space cleanup, line lengths,
	  docstrings, copyright notice. No code change.

2009-05-07 08:58  alaaosh

	* storage/base.py: after all this time turns out I didn't
	  understand how plurals work.
	  added check for hasplural before looping over strings.
	  I still think all units should have a strings list though :-(

2009-05-07 08:37  friedelwolff

	* filters/test_checks.py: White space cleanup

2009-05-07 08:22  friedelwolff

	* filters/pofilter.py: If the user asks for a header, take over the
	  one from the original file (probably not cpo safe). This fixes
	  the second part of bug 950

2009-05-05 14:09  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Removed superfluous comma that
	  caused very bad things to happen. My cat is dead. :(

2009-05-05 14:07  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Removed commented out class
	  TerminologyPlaceable, because it lives in terminology.py.

2009-05-05 12:58  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: + UrlPlaceable
	  + FilePlaceable
	  + EmailPlaceable
	  Written by Dwayne.

2009-04-30 16:04  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.delete_range():
	  Apparently case 1 is sometimes disguised as case 2.
	  (Case 1 and 2 is explained in a comment above the patched area of
	  the file.)

2009-04-30 16:03  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: StringElem.elem_offset(): First
	  finish looking for the same instance (parameter) element, before
	  searching for its string-equivalent.

2009-04-30 13:29  friedelwolff

	* storage/statsdb.py: Update copyright date. Whitespace cleanup.

2009-04-30 13:10  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/parse.py: Ensure that, if the same parsing
	  function occurs multiple times, a parsed placeable is not parsed
	  again, creating an identical sub-node.

2009-04-30 13:09  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Added another case in
	  StringElem.delete_range(): Deleting the entire current string
	  (self).

2009-04-30 02:01  alaaosh

	* storage/statsdb.py: use get_config_id instead of
	  _getstoredcheckerconfig just in case a different checker is
	  required for recaching unit stats

2009-04-30 01:57  alaaosh

	* storage/base.py, storage/xliff.py: add suggestions_in_format
	  property

2009-04-30 01:53  alaaosh

	* storage/base.py: don't access self.filename directly sometimes it
	  doesn't exist

2009-04-30 01:50  alaaosh

	* storage/base.py: makeindex now keeps track of multiple units with
	  the same source
	  sourceindex is a mapping of source strings and lists now
	  findunit returns the first unit from the list, use findunits if
	  you want the whole list

2009-04-30 01:48  alaaosh

	* tools/pomerge.py: use findunit instead of directly accessing
	  sourceindex

2009-04-30 01:28  alaaosh

	* storage/statsdb.py: split unit state stats is a separate function
	  filestatestats

2009-04-30 01:26  alaaosh

	* storage/base.py: make most translation stores serializable
	  (libxml based stores are not)

2009-04-29 15:55  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: If we couldn't find an ancestor to
	  insert the text into, use self.

2009-04-29 15:54  walter_l

	* storage/pypo.py: Make sure that pypo also invalidates cached
	  self._rich_target in settarget().

2009-04-29 15:20  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Handle the special case where the
	  element to delete is self (the root).

2009-04-29 15:20  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Make StringElem.delete_range()
	  return the deleted string.

2009-04-29 14:28  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Have StringElem.prune() also
	  delete empty elements.

2009-04-29 14:27  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Use iter_depth_first() in stead of
	  depth_first() where possible.

2009-04-29 14:26  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Make StringElem.iter_depth_first()
	  actually act like an iterator.

2009-04-29 14:25  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: + StringElem.delete_range() -
	  Delete elements and/or sub-strings in the tree between given
	  indices.
	  + StringElem.delete_elem() - Used by delete_range()
	  + StringElem.get_index_data() - Used by delete_range()

2009-04-28 16:31  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/test_base.py: + TestStringElem.test_insert() -
	  Basic tests for StringElem.insert().

2009-04-28 16:30  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: + StringElem.insert(offset, text)
	  - Insert the given text (unicode or StringElem - str if you
	  *have* to) into the tree.
	  The method tries to select the best possible node to insert the
	  text at.

2009-04-28 16:29  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: +
	  StringElem.get_ancestor_where(elem, f) - Find an ancestor of elem
	  for which f(ancestor) returns True.

2009-04-24 16:05  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py, storage/placeables/parse.py,
	  storage/placeables/strelem.py, storage/placeables/test_lisa.py:
	  To make a long story short: Leaves in StringElem trees have gone
	  back to being defined
	  as "a StringElem (not sub-class) node containing only str or
	  unicode children". It caused
	  a lot of breakage in other code that needed to be fixed.

2009-04-24 16:04  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: + StringElem.prune(): Remove
	  unnecessary nodes from the tree.

2009-04-24 16:03  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py, storage/placeables/strelem.py,
	  storage/placeables/terminology.py,
	  storage/placeables/test_base.py, storage/placeables/test_lisa.py,
	  tools/podebug.py: StringElem's first argument containing the new
	  node's children need not be a list anymore; it is automatically
	  put in a list if necessary.
	  A lot of other code was also updated to reflect this change and
	  make the code a bit cleaner as a result.

2009-04-23 13:16  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py: Handle non-existent DOM nodes (like

	  the flattened list.

2009-04-15 13:56  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Add a 'credits' check for the Mozilla checker

2009-04-09 15:50  walter_l

	  of a node/tree.

2009-04-09 15:49  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/xliff.py: Removed the __unicode__ method from
	  XLIFF placeables, because the XML representations should be done
	  by the stores, not StringElem tree.

2009-04-09 14:40  alaaosh

	* search/indexing/XapianIndexer.py: under mod_wsgi check for apache
	  instead of _apache, and all of this
	  because GIL sucks

2009-04-09 13:30  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py: Handle rid's and xid's for "empty"
	  (non-paired) placeables (like <x/>).

2009-04-09 11:26  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Add PunctuationPlaceable to the
	  list of possible conversions for general.Ph placeables.

2009-04-09 11:25  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/test_base.py,
	  storage/placeables/test_terminology.py: The recently-added
	  PunctuationPlaceable caused test data to change. Tests are now
	  updated to reflect the changes.

2009-04-09 10:38  walter_l

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Added XLIFF test and required scaffolding.

2009-04-09 10:38  walter_l

	  work correctly with rich_source and rich_target.

2009-04-08 10:22  walter_l

2009-04-08 10:20  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: Add Pashto (ps) plural information. Minor
	  whitespace cleanup.

2009-04-07 15:46  walter_l

	* tools/podebug.py: multistring and unicode strings don't have an
	  insert() method, so we should use a more generic method to add a
	  prefix.

2009-04-07 13:04  friedelwolff

	* storage/odf_io.py: Open the ZIP file as a binary file for the
	  sake of Windows. This should fix bug 816.

	* storage/ts2.py: Use the more modern lxml API that is more
	  readible and less error prone

2009-04-07 08:54  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Only consider translated units as usable

2009-04-07 08:12  alaaosh

	* search/indexing/XapianIndexer.py: don't import xapian bindings

	  content.

2009-03-24 15:37  walter_l

	* search/match.py: Collect terminologycomparer.match_info in
	  terminologymatcher.match_info.

2009-03-19 16:05  walter_l

	* search/match.py: For the terminology matcher, we need the
	  candidates in reversed size-sorted order (longest first).

2009-03-19 16:04  walter_l

	* search/terminology.py: + TerminologyComparer.match_info dict. It
	  holds more information about matches found.
	  It's kind of hackish, because it needs to be clear manually, but
	  at least it doesn't change
	  the API. :/

2009-03-19 16:03  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: rename StringElem.transform() to
	  StringElem.translate() and give it a new implementation.

2009-03-19 13:59  walter_l

	* search/match.py, search/terminology.py: Cosmetic changes.

2009-03-19 13:56  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py: StringElem.isleaf() no longer returns
	  True only for StringElem leaves, so we have to check for that
	  ourselves.

	* storage/placeables/parse.py: Test using type(x) in stead of
	  x.__class__.

2009-03-19 13:52  walter_l

	  has content that is not present in the PO file.

2009-03-16 16:34  walter_l

	  Finds a given node's parent node in the current tree.

2009-03-16 16:28  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: isleaf() should also return True
	  for StringElem sub-classes that only contain str|unicode
	  children.

2009-03-16 13:40  walter_l

	* misc/rich.py, storage/base.py, storage/placeables/base.py,

2009-03-12 15:55  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/strelem.py: Fix StringElem.flatten() to also
	  work if the string tree is only one node that of is a StringElem
	  sub-class.

2009-03-11 15:41  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/test_base.py: Added tests for
	  StringElem.elem_offset() and StringElem.isleaf()

2009-03-11 15:41  walter_l

	  identity testing ("is") in stead of equality testing ("==").

2009-03-10 09:47  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py, storage/placeables/lisa.py,
	  storage/placeables/test_lisa.py, storage/test_ts2.py,

2009-03-04 15:13  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: XMLEntityPlaceable.parse(): s/+1//
	  It causes the parser to consume one character too many.

2009-03-04 15:12  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/general.py: Use unicode.find() in stead of
	  unicode.index() which raises a ValueError if the sub-string was

	  * placeables.py is removed

2009-03-04 14:37  friedelwolff

	  unicode strings

2009-03-04 13:53  friedelwolff

	* lang/af.py: Don't handle a number as a sentence start - this

	* storage/base.py: merge on rich target instead of target

2009-03-03 13:33  alaaosh

	* misc/rich.py: renamed .content to .subelems

2009-03-03 13:18  alaaosh

	* storage/placeables/general.py: use regexp when matching xml
	  entities, otherwise we barf on strings
	  with & that are not part of entities

2009-03-03 13:15  alaaosh

	* storage/placeables/interfaces.py: should be possible to construct
	  placeable classes with no argumentsg

2009-03-03 10:47  walter_l

	* storage/test_ts2.py: Updated test_ts2.py, although it's not
	  completely done yet.

2009-03-03 10:46  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/xliff.py: Swap parent classes for XLIFF
	  placeables.

2009-03-03 10:46  walter_l

	* storage/lisa.py: -
	  translate.storage.lisa.LISAunit._ensure_singular()

2009-03-03 10:45  walter_l

	* storage/test_ts2.py: Use valid XML strings to test ts2 with.

2009-03-03 10:43  walter_l

	* storage/test_base.py, storage/ts2.py: Fixed license blocks.

2009-03-03 07:02  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_base.py: Rename that went unnoticed in r10307

2009-03-02 16:20  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py: Fix typo

2009-03-02 16:06  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py: Avoid "reference before assignment"
	  error by providing a default value.

2009-03-02 15:22  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/lisa.py: Make "id" attributes of empty
	  replaceable classes optional.

2009-03-02 14:15  walter_l

	* storage/base.py: s/(source|target)_rich/rich_(source|target)/

2009-03-02 14:13  walter_l

	* tools/podebug.py: Fixed translate.tools.podebug.add_prefix() to
	  be StringElem-aware.

2009-03-02 13:55  winterstream

	* storage/pypo.py: When deepcopying a unit, we don't want the
	  reference _store to
	  be deep copied (since otherwise, we copy the entire store every
	  time deepcopy a unit).
	  
	  We use the __shallow__ class variable to indicate which members
	  should always be copied in a shallow manner.

2009-03-02 13:49  winterstream

	* lang/common.py: When deep copying a singleton, we just want the
	  singleton itself returned.

2009-03-02 10:54  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py: Reimplemented StringElem.find() to
	  use unicode.find(). It works much better now.

2009-02-27 15:58  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py: Fixed method name.

2009-02-27 08:58  friedelwolff

	* lang/ne.py, lang/test_ne.py: Initial support for Nepali (ne).
	  This is mostly to handle the spaced full stop and question mark
	  correctly, but probably needs more attention.

2009-02-27 08:54  friedelwolff

	* lang/common.py: Add special code to hopefully handle properly
	  with ellipses for once and for all. Too many three character
	  ellipses are still out in the wild, so we have to handle this
	  properly.

2009-02-27 08:51  friedelwolff

	* lang/test_common.py: Extra test for segmentation among newlines

2009-02-26 15:14  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py: + StringElem.elem_offset()
	  + Minor updates

2009-02-26 15:13  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py, storage/placeables/general.py: Make
	  XMLEntityPlaceable and XMLTagPlaceable non-editable.

2009-02-26 14:00  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py, storage/placeables/test_base.py:
	  s/find_elem_with/find_elems_with/

2009-02-26 13:58  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/test_base.py: + test_elem_at_iter() - Testing
	  for StringElem.elem_at_iter()

2009-02-26 13:57  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py: + elem_at_offset(), depth_first(),
	  iter_depth_first() for the StringElem class.

2009-02-26 11:12  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/test_base.py: + Tests for find() and
	  find_elem_with() methods in StringElem.

2009-02-26 11:08  walter_l

	* storage/placeables/base.py: + find() and find_elem_with() methods
	  in StringElem.

2009-02-26 08:24  walter_l

	* storage/stringelem: Delete empty storage/stringelem dir.

2009-02-25 16:39  walter_l

	  storage/test_tmx.py, storage/test_wordfast.py,
	  storage/test_xliff.py, storage/xml_extract/extract.py: * A huge
	  lot of changes to merge the StringElem class into
	  storage.placeables.base.Placeable.
	  * Imports were updated all over the translate.storage module to
	  use the new layout.
	  * Tests were added and updated to use the new placeables and
	  their layout.

2009-02-25 16:10  walter_l

	* storage/test_base.py: + Tests for TranslationUnit's new
	  source_strelem and target_strelem properties.

2009-02-25 16:01  walter_l

	* storage/stringelem/strelem.py: Change StringElem to be
	  unicode-like in stead of a unicode. The main reason for this is
	  that we need the StringElem trees to be mutable.
	  There are other reasons. This also meant that we have to provide
	  our own encode() method for StringElem.

2009-02-25 15:51  walter_l

	* storage/base.py: + TranslationUnit.source_strelem property
	  + TranslationUnit.target_strelem property

2009-02-25 15:41  walter_l

	* storage/stringelem/__init__.py: + stringelem/__init__.py

2009-02-25 14:59  walter_l

	* storage/stringelem/test_strelem.py: * Some refactoring of
	  variable names in the test
	  + test_tree() which tests each part of the tree for the correct
	  content.

2009-02-25 14:51  walter_l

	* storage/richstring/strelem.py,
	  storage/richstring/test_strelem.py, storage/stringelem,
	  storage/stringelem/strelem.py,
	  storage/stringelem/test_strelem.py: storage/richstring ->
	  storage/stringelem

2009-02-25 14:39  walter_l

	* storage/richstring/test_strelem.py: + Some tests for StringElem
	  trees.

2009-02-25 14:31  walter_l

	* storage/richstring/strelem.py: * More consistent use of unicode()
	  * Implemented StringElem.flatten()
	  * Added parsing class methods as well as parser() function to use
	  them.

2009-02-25 14:21  walter_l

	* storage/richstring, storage/richstring/strelem.py: + StringElem
	  base class and basic implementations.

2009-02-25 08:44  friedelwolff

	* storage/poparser.py: If any unexpected character is obtained
	  after a #, accept the comment as translator (other) comment.
	  Reported by Sayamindu Dasgupta. This commit fixes bug 867.

2009-02-24 19:35  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py, storage/test_pypo.py: Previous msgid and previos
	  msgid_plural should come after type comments. +Test.

2009-02-24 07:36  friedelwolff

	* lang/fa.py, lang/ur.py: Avoid problems when punctranslate alters
	  a %x style variable to the Arabic percent sign

2009-02-23 16:51  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Add a French punctuation test. Add gconf
	  test_ that I forgot to add with the gconf test implementation.

2009-02-20 09:44  murgilduta

	* filters/spelling.py: Since we are phasing it out, we don't want
	  to try to import jToolkit's spellcheching module anymore.

	* convert/odf2xliff.py, storage/xliff.py: [Contributed by Nick

2009-02-12 16:59  dupuy

	* lang/common.py, storage/csvl10n.py, storage/wordfast.py,
	  tools/test_pomerge.py: spelling fix: seperate->separate
	  (user-visible and comments; variables/methods left misspelled)

2009-02-12 15:50  alaaosh

	* README, convert/po2sub, convert/po2sub.py, convert/sub2po,
	  convert/sub2po.py, storage/subtitles.py: We can now convert
	  subtitle formats support by Gaupol

2009-02-12 08:45  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: Add missing import

2009-02-12 08:36  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: Add Bengali (India) (bn_IN) that usually has its
	  own team

2009-02-12 08:30  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: On Windows a normal call to gettext.translation
	  seems to invoke the 'C' locale - obviously what somebody using a
	  cross-platform programming language would want. So we rather hack
	  around it by using locale.getdefaultlocale() which we will
	  probably eventually regret. This at least gives us translated
	  language names in Virtaal.

2009-02-10 21:54  nekral

	* misc/test_optrecurse.py: TestRecursiveOptionParser has no base
	  class. Remove unneeded parenthesis.

2009-02-09 13:26  alaaosh

	* lang/data.py: fixing arabic plural form, can't believe that
	  slipped by me until now

2009-02-05 08:55  winterstream

	* convert/po2web2py, convert/po2web2py.py, convert/web2py2po,
	  convert/web2py2po.py: [Contributed by Dominic König
	  (dominic@nursix.org)]
	  
	  Convertors to convert between PO and web2py's translation format.

2009-02-04 15:35  friedelwolff

	* ChangeLog: Update ChangeLog before release of version 1.3.0

2009-02-04 14:46  friedelwolff

	* README: Mention more recent version of lxml that should be better

2009-02-04 13:01  friedelwolff

	* __version__.py: Version 1.3.0

2009-02-04 11:29  friedelwolff

	* lang/bn.py: Data for proper sentence endings, sentencere and
	  puncdict. We should now do punctranslate correctly for Bengali.

2009-02-04 11:28  friedelwolff

	* lang/code_or.py: Remove unnecessary data members that are filled
	  in by the factory

2009-02-04 11:21  friedelwolff

	* lang/code_or.py, lang/test_or.py: Only replace full stop with
	  space or newline with the DEVANAGARI DANDA. This should avoid
	  problems with numbers, code, etc. Needs more testing, though.

2009-02-04 11:20  friedelwolff

	* lang/common.py: Small cleanup to ensure we are using unicode
	  strings, and strip space on the end of we are replacing
	  punctuation at the end of strings and our transformation might
	  have added a space

2009-02-03 15:41  friedelwolff

	* lang/fr.py, lang/test_fr.py: Support fancy (curly) quotes when
	  translating punctuation for French

2009-02-02 13:30  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: Rewrite settarget to take loads of things into
	  account. This mostly fixes bug 774.

2009-01-31 18:30  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: Make the gettext_lang() function use the system
	  locale if none is given as paramter

2009-01-30 18:13  alaaosh

	* storage/tmdb.py: how many corners does this thing have

2009-01-30 17:41  alaaosh

	* storage/tmdb.py: handle the weird situation where a db
	  initialized with fts3 support is
	  opened without fts3 support

2009-01-30 17:23  friedelwolff

	* __version__.py: Version 1.3-rc1

2009-01-30 16:48  alaaosh

	* lang/data.py: simpler more correct simplercode
	  simplify_to_common takes an optional language list/dict now

2009-01-30 11:04  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py: Only add the current year if the contributor
	  is already listed for earlier years

2009-01-30 10:55  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py: In .upatecontributor(), also test if we have
	  the current year listed in the contributor comments

2009-01-29 18:35  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py: Gconf test. Gconf settings should not be
	  translated. Test is enabled only with --gnome.
	  Fixed bug 781

2009-01-29 16:48  winterstream

	* storage/poparser.py, storage/pypo.py, storage/test_pypo.py: Added
	  the functionality to deal with previous msgid info (i.e.
	  everything appearing in #| comments).
	  
	  There are three new member variables in the pypo unit class:
	  prev_msgctxt, prev_msgid and prev_msgid_plural.
	  
	  The previous msgid and msgid_plural can be set via prev_source.
	  
	  The prev_source and source properties use the same code which
	  was factored out from getsource and setsource (used by the
	  source property).

2009-01-29 16:32  dwaynebailey

	* storage/ts2.py: Add target language support. Fixes bug 789

2009-01-29 15:08  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: add psyco support

2009-01-29 15:01  friedelwolff

	* storage/mo.py: The .mo class also implements poheader. This
	  ensures that we can read language and other headers correctly
	  from mo files.

2009-01-29 14:29  alaaosh

	* services/opentranclient.py, services/restclient.py,
	  services/tmclient.py: move gtk dependant client code to virtaal,
	  need to create simple
	  example tmclient in toolkit

2009-01-29 13:52  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: add --debug command line option

2009-01-29 09:33  friedelwolff

	* filters/test_checks.py: Test that startpunc handles the inverted
	  Spanish question mark correctly

2009-01-29 08:42  dupuy

	* lang/es.py: language class for Spanish suppresses only bogus
	  pofilter startpunc gripes

2009-01-29 08:07  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Adapt to the new API
	  where forcing to unicode doesn't normalize. Call
	  data.normalized_unicode() instead

2009-01-29 08:05  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: Don't automatically normalize when coercing to
	  unicode. Provide the normalized_unicode() function for that
	  purpose.

2009-01-28 22:08  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Only strip on the right for the endpunc test

2009-01-28 21:48  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Also test for colon (:) in puncend, and strip
	  spaces to ensure that we test punctuation even if the message is
	  spaced

2009-01-28 21:11  friedelwolff

	* filters/pofilter.py: Remove debug statement

2009-01-28 20:30  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: Rewrite .getlocations() to avoid lxml warning of
	  deprecated API

2009-01-28 14:20  alaaosh

	* storage/tmdb.py, tools/build_tmdb.py: cleanup

2009-01-28 13:34  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: ignore_kde function appears twice.

2009-01-28 04:34  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_oo2po.py, storage/oo.py, storage/test_oo.py: Convert
	  OOo help escaping, resolves bug 694
	  
	  Previously we escaped all of OOo help tags except tags that we
	  identified as unescaped. This caused problems where translators
	  introduced new 'tags' in their transations.
	  
	  We now don't escape anything unless it is on our list of tags
	  that should be escaped. A translator who uses one of these tags,
	  which could be a valid word in their language, will still suffer.
	  But that is unlikely to happen and can be worked around.

2009-01-27 14:42  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: In .settaret(), try at all cost to not replace
	  the whole targetNode. This keeps extra XML stuff around that we
	  might not be aware of. This fixes bug 751.

2009-01-27 14:33  friedelwolff

	* lang/ar.py: Don't translate the Arabic percentage sign as part of
	  punctuation translation - it is likely to cause too much problems
	  with variables

2009-01-26 10:11  winterstream

	* misc/contextlib.py: contextlib.py still contained a 'yield'
	  inside a try: except: clause,
	  which is invalid in Python 2.4. The yield was moved out of this
	  clause.

2009-01-26 09:49  winterstream

	* storage/xliff.py: When merging XLIFF files, comments weren't
	  merged. This patch fixes the
	  problem.

2009-01-26 09:48  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: log to logging.info instead of stderror

2009-01-26 09:11  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: disable reverse dns lookup on every request

2009-01-26 08:38  winterstream

	* convert/oo2xliff.py: When converting from OpenOffice.org SDF
	  files to XLIFF files we should
	  not indiscriminately mark the units in the generated XLIFF files
	  as
	  "approved".
	  
	  This simple fix will mark a unit as approved (or "non-fuzzy" in
	  the
	  terminology of the toolkit) if the target string is not empty.
	  Otherwise
	  it is marked as non-approved (or "fuzzy" in the terminology of
	  the
	  toolkit).

2009-01-26 07:56  friedelwolff

	* lang/common.py: Remove debug print statements

2009-01-25 17:20  dwaynebailey

	* lang/poedit.py, lang/test_poedit.py, storage/poheader.py: Add
	  support for Poedit X-Poedit-Language markers. This will lookup
	  the correct ISO code based
	  on the Poedit language name. The code will also cleanup PO
	  headers to use the correct
	  'Language' entry and drop the old X-Poedit-Language and
	  X-Poedit-Country tags.
	  
	  This fixes bug 737.

2009-01-24 17:37  friedelwolff

	* filters/pofilter.py, filters/test_pofilter.py: Add the --nonotes
	  parameter to pofilter so that the addition of notes can be
	  supressed. This fixes bug 745

2009-01-24 17:36  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Add an API to remove comments from a specific
	  origin

2009-01-24 07:52  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: Change several language names to align well with
	  iso-codes. This gives slightly clumsy names when it is
	  untranslated, but gives reasonable coverage for those languages
	  with translations. There are still some where we are not aligned,
	  and probably won't be since the untranslated forms are ugly (fy,
	  el, km, nb, nn, nso)

2009-01-23 10:45  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py: we where being too smart for our own
	  good. restclient is unable to
	  make efficiency decisions about duplicate requests since it
	  doesn't
	  know anything about who's connected to it's own signals.
	  
	  queue management should be done in virtaal.

2009-01-22 15:45  friedelwolff

	* __version__.py: Version 1.3beta1

2009-01-22 11:13  alaaosh

	* misc/selector.py: don't fail when resolver module is missing, not
	  required for tmserver

2009-01-22 10:20  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver, services/tmserver.py, tools/build_tmdb,
	  tools/build_tmdb.py: when in windows ...

2009-01-22 08:29  friedelwolff

	* storage/tmdb.py: Fall back to the older sqlite module in case
	  we're running on Python 2.4

2009-01-21 14:50  alaaosh

	* services/tmclient.py, services/tmserver.py: implemented add store
	  functionality (POST and PUT methods for /store urls)

2009-01-21 14:48  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py: One does not simply walk into cURL It's
	  black gates are guarded by
	  more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep.
	  
	  fixed POST and PUT requests.

2009-01-21 14:44  alaaosh

	* storage/tmdb.py: added add_list method to add list of dictionary
	  units to tmdb
	  add_list and add_store now return a count of translated units
	  (should
	  replace that with an actual count of newly added units)

2009-01-21 14:05  friedelwolff

	* tools/pogrep.py: Refactor common parts of the matches() code.
	  Provide correct start and end indexes in the original string,
	  considering that it was never normalised.

2009-01-20 10:53  alaaosh

	* lang/data.py: added simply_to_common function, useful for
	  stripping extra
	  information from language codes when not needed.

2009-01-20 09:05  alaaosh

	* services/tmclient.py, storage/tmdb.py: do language code
	  normalization as late as possible

2009-01-20 09:02  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py: make sure url is in utf-8, fixes bug #706

2009-01-19 21:20  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py, services/tmclient.py, storage/tmdb.py: Rename new
	  .normalize() to .normalize_code() to avoid name clash and rename
	  all users. Tests should now be restored.

2009-01-19 19:18  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: United Kingdom iso3166 code is GB not UK

2009-01-19 16:38  alaaosh

	* services/tmclient.py: normalize language codes before creating
	  requests

2009-01-19 16:34  alaaosh

	* storage/tmdb.py: now we can save units represented as
	  dictionaires.
	  also normalize language before insertion

2009-01-19 16:30  alaaosh

	* lang/data.py: seperate normalization of language code in it's own
	  function

2009-01-19 15:18  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py: pounit.isheader() should not return false just
	  because we have locations. This fixes bug 629.

2009-01-19 15:08  friedelwolff

	* convert/convert.py, convert/html2po.py, convert/mozfunny2prop.py,
	  convert/oo2xliff.py, convert/test_html2po.py: Remove --duplicates
	  styles from the converters: msgid_comment, keep,
	  msgid_comment_all. This is part of fixing 663.

2009-01-19 13:48  friedelwolff

	* convert/oo2po.py: Only set the source and target language after
	  we have a valid header, otherwise we might add a second

2009-01-19 13:07  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Expand forceunicode docstring

2009-01-19 08:51  alaaosh

	* search/match.py, services/tmserver.py, storage/tmdb.py: committed
	  debug code by mistake

2009-01-17 17:39  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Document language and country codes dictionaries.

2009-01-17 17:31  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Add variable comment

2009-01-17 17:28  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Move comment to an epydoc description for the
	  dictionary.

2009-01-17 17:23  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Fix docstring. I think maybe I need to give some
	  epydoc lessons.

2009-01-17 10:49  dwaynebailey

	* convert/csv2po, convert/html2po, convert/ini2po, convert/moz2po,

	* convert/ical2po, convert/po2ical: Fix indentation

2009-01-17 10:00  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Ignore 'LTR' config for KDE files. Even though
	  we don't check the actual filename (its only present in
	  kdelibs(4).po
	  it should be OK).

2009-01-16 15:51  alaaosh

	* search/match.py: use getnotes() instead of .othercomments, fixes
	  #660

2009-01-16 14:24  alaaosh

	* services/opentranclient.py: make it possible to change languages
	  in the middle of a session
	  clean up language negotiation

2009-01-16 14:23  alaaosh

	* services/tmclient.py: tmserver is language aware now

2009-01-16 14:19  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py: make curl verbose when logging level is
	  DEBUG

2009-01-16 14:08  friedelwolff

	* misc/file_discovery.py: Add the RESOURCEPATH from the mac app
	  bundle to the BASE_DIRS where we search for data

2009-01-16 09:55  dwaynebailey

	* convert/ini2po.py, convert/po2ini.py, storage/ini.py: Add
	  Innosetup support

2009-01-15 19:27  walter_l

	* storage/pocommon.py: Swap the parent classes of pofile to make
	  sure that the right settargetlanguage() is used.

2009-01-15 19:26  walter_l

	* storage/poheader.py: "basestr" -> "basestring"

2009-01-15 16:32  alaaosh

	* tools/build_tmdb.py: clean up, nothing is hardcoded now

2009-01-15 15:36  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: Handle hyphen (-) underscore (_) and at-sign (@) as
	  delimiters in .simplercode()

2009-01-14 16:49  alaaosh

	* storage/tmdb.py: don't do full text matching on small strings

2009-01-14 14:59  friedelwolff

	* storage/tmx.py: Replace lxml.etree calls with faster parts of the
	  API

2009-01-14 14:45  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: migrate server to tmdb backend

2009-01-14 14:43  alaaosh

	* lang/ar.py: acronyms are transliterated in arabic

2009-01-14 14:36  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py: Implement .istranslatable() to ensure that
	  headers are not considered translatable by our tools. The general
	  XLIFF implementation doesn't work since the PO representation
	  guide prescribes that PO headers should be translatable in the
	  XLIFF file. Now at least Virtaal won't give it to users.

2009-01-14 14:30  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py: Use the proper inherrited .addunit() so that
	  ._store is correct. This fixes bug 696.

2009-01-14 12:31  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py: Replace lxml.etree calls with faster parts of
	  the API

2009-01-14 08:39  alaaosh

	* tools/build_tmdb.py: build tmdb out of translation files

2009-01-14 08:15  alaaosh

	* storage/tm_db.py, storage/tmdb.py: tmdb.py is a better name

2009-01-13 16:08  alaaosh

	* storage/tm_db.py: full text indexing support

2009-01-13 15:28  walter_l

	* tools/pogrep.py: Also return empty list for indexes if the there
	  is no search to perform.

2009-01-13 15:09  walter_l

	* tools/pogrep.py: Check if a unit has plurals before assuming its
	  source(s) and target(s) have a "strings" attribute.
	  This is part of the fix for bug 693.

2009-01-13 13:48  walter_l

	* tools/pogrep.py: virtaal.modes.searchmode.SearchMatch ->
	  translate.tools.pogrep.GrepMatch
	  virtaal.modes.searchmode.SearchMode.get_matches() ->
	  translate.tools.pogrep.GrepFilter.getmatches()

2009-01-13 08:49  walter_l

	* misc/file_discovery.py: Prefer $XDG_DATA_HOME if available.

2009-01-12 16:03  winterstream

	* storage/poparser.py: Oops. With no space after "msgid" in the
	  startswith function, we'd
	  also get x.startswith('msgid') == True if x == 'msgid_plural',
	  which
	  is not what we want.
	  
	  The fix is just to add spaces after "msgid".

2009-01-12 15:56  winterstream

	* storage/poparser.py: The new PO parser broke if it saw CHARSET as
	  the encoding of POT
	  files. It now assumes that such files are UTF-8 encoded.

2009-01-12 15:49  walter_l

	* misc/optrecurse.py, storage/poheader.py, storage/tmx.py,
	  storage/xpi.py: Use __version__.sver in stead of __version__.ver.

2009-01-12 15:00  walter_l

	* __init__.py, __version__.py: __version__.ver -> __version__.sver
	  + __version__.ver = (1, 2, 1)
	  + License header for __version__.py
	  Updated header for __init__.py

2009-01-12 11:56  alaaosh

	* storage/tm_db.py: new much simpler implementation

2009-01-12 06:00  dwaynebailey

	* i18n.py: gettext.install define _ so we don't need to redefine.

2009-01-10 15:28  dwaynebailey

	* i18n.py, po/POTFILES.in, storage/base.py, storage/csvl10n.py,
	  storage/mo.py, storage/pocommon.py, storage/qm.py,
	  storage/qph.py, storage/tbx.py, storage/tmx.py, storage/ts2.py,
	  storage/wordfast.py, storage/xliff.py: Introduce some
	  localisation framework. Make all bilingual format description
	  localisable.

2009-01-10 14:10  dwaynebailey

	* po, po/Makevars, po/POTFILES.in, po/POTFILES.skip: Put structure
	  in place for localisation of toolkit files.

2009-01-10 14:09  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Use better lxml APIs for speedup

2009-01-10 12:18  friedelwolff

	* misc/setup.py: Remove the installer for the old C CSV library
	  that was removed earlier

2009-01-09 14:40  winterstream

	* convert/test_pot2po.py, storage/poparser.py: After we've read the
	  optional msgctxt and the msgid when doing
	  obsolete parsing, then we should terminate the parsing of the
	  current obsolete unit when we see either a msgctxt or a msgid,
	  since either means that we've hit a new obsolete unit.
	  
	  Also fixed the unit test case that tests this functionality.

2009-01-09 14:30  winterstream

	* storage/poparser.py: Our parser didn't deal with msgctxt in
	  obsolete units properly, due
	  to the fact that we bailed if we saw a msgid when parsing an
	  obsolete;
	  of course, one would see a msgid directly after a msgctxt...

2009-01-09 14:16  walter_l

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: +Test for preservation of msgctxt values
	  in obsolete units.

2009-01-09 10:06  walter_l

	* storage/poparser.py: Ensure that all header fields are decoded.

2009-01-09 09:58  winterstream

	* storage/test_po.py: Turns out that our new parser forgets to
	  decode header comments.
	  So if you're calling getnotes() on the header, you get a
	  UnicodeDecodeError.
	  
	  A fix is in the pipeline, but for now we have a test to trigger
	  the error.

2009-01-08 21:54  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: Massive optimisation of lisa class by using
	  better lxml methods. Some operations are running at less than 40%
	  of previous time. XLIFF and possibly other child classes still to
	  be done for possible small extra gain.

2009-01-08 10:38  walter_l

	* misc/file_discovery.py: Updated get_abs_data_filename() to allow
	  directories to be specified as well as using XDG_DATA_DIRS.

2009-01-07 14:17  walter_l

	* services/__init__.py, services/lookupclient.py,
	  services/lookupservice.py, services/restclient.py,
	  services/tmclient.py: Removed unnecessary trailing whitespace.

2009-01-06 20:57  friedelwolff

	* lang/zh.py: Provide a slightly different length estimation
	  heuristic for Chinese

2009-01-06 20:55  friedelwolff

	* lang/common.py, lang/data.py: Provide a method for a language
	  object .alter_length() to return a string optionally made longer
	  or shorter to use in length estimations when leaving space in the
	  GUI. This uses a basic heuristic using constants defined in
	  data::expansion_factors, although the length difference can be
	  redefined per language to use a different heuristic.

2009-01-06 14:56  alaaosh

	* services/opentranclient.py: don't query opentran till we
	  negotiate a supported language, fixes #635

2009-01-06 07:49  winterstream

	* misc/quote.py: Reverted misc/quote.py. This was supposed to be
	  experimental code, but
	  it seems to have slipped in anyway.

2009-01-05 15:10  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py: hack to fix 636 doesn't really fix it,
	  but logs instead of barfing. we
	  need to know when and why certain requests get deleted twice.

2009-01-05 07:43  friedelwolff

	* services/opentranclient.py: Check for fuzzyness at the 'flag'
	  value - we really don't want to suggest fuzzy translations

2009-01-02 18:15  friedelwolff

	* storage/qm.py: Raise an exception when somebody tries to write
	  out a QM file. This sort of fixes bug 516.

2008-12-30 14:04  friedelwolff

	* storage/tm_db.py: rough first version of a tm db optimised for
	  reading

2008-12-27 19:41  friedelwolff

	* services/tmserver.py: Remove unused imports and clean up
	  whitespace

2008-12-27 19:36  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py, storage/base.py: Remove some unused attributes
	  that weren't being used anywhere

2008-12-27 13:26  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py: Privatise .msgidlen() and .msgstrlen() - can't
	  we get rid of these?

2008-12-26 14:24  friedelwolff

	* misc/hash.py, storage/html.py, tools/podebug.py: [Contributed by
	  Leonardo Ferreira Fontenelle] Provide a wrapper for the md5
	  library that is located in different places in different versions
	  of Python. Use this rather to avoid deprecation warnings. This
	  fixes bug 634.

2008-12-19 14:55  alaaosh

	* services/opentranclient.py: commented out debugging output

2008-12-19 14:53  alaaosh

	* search/match.py, services/tmserver.py: move unit2dict to
	  search.match

2008-12-19 12:53  walter_l

	* services/opentranclient.py: Removed prints and trailing
	  whitespace.

2008-12-19 09:03  alaaosh

	* services/opentranclient.py: something stinks in the state of
	  unicode

2008-12-19 08:21  alaaosh

	* services/opentranclient.py: move quality calculation and result
	  filtering code from virtaal

2008-12-18 23:53  clouserw

	* convert/po2tiki.py, convert/test_po2tiki.py,
	  convert/test_tiki2po.py, convert/tiki2po.py,
	  storage/test_tiki.py, storage/tiki.py: po's addlocations()
	  appears to split on spaces. Fixing tiki2po to use location names
	  with no spaces.

2008-12-18 21:35  friedelwolff

	* services/opentranclient.py: Don't assign a bogus quality - let
	  the consumer decide what to do with it

2008-12-18 17:19  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: getting closer to update tm features

2008-12-18 17:18  alaaosh

	* services/opentranclient.py: negotiate target language

2008-12-18 17:15  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py: better handling of running state to allow
	  recursive non blocking requests

2008-12-17 16:40  alaaosh

	* services/opentranclient.py: first attempts at opentran client
	  used by virtaal

2008-12-17 14:22  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: switch to own copy of selector

2008-12-17 14:21  alaaosh

	* misc/selector.py: match multiline urls

2008-12-17 14:20  alaaosh

	* misc/selector.py: use by tmserver

2008-12-17 11:13  friedelwolff

	* tests/odf_xliff/test_odf_xliff.py: Factor out file name constats
	  and do proper module cleanup. Minor whitespace cleanup.

2008-12-17 11:09  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py, services/tmclient.py: move json code to
	  tmclient, make restclient more generic

2008-12-17 10:15  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2symb, convert/po2symb.py, convert/symb2po,
	  convert/symb2po.py: Clean up license headers, copyright dates,
	  whitespace and some docstrings

2008-12-17 09:12  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py, services/tmserver.py: urllib barfs on
	  unicode, fixes #631

2008-12-17 08:55  winterstream

	* convert/symb2po.py: This broke when calling symb2po without a
	  template, since
	  template_dict['r_string_languagegroup_name'] would raise
	  a key error. This is now fixed.

2008-12-17 08:53  friedelwolff

	* convert/symb_common.py: Remove moved module symb_common

2008-12-17 08:52  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2symb.py, convert/symb2po.py, storage/symbian.py: Move
	  the symb_common module to storage/symbian, since it mostly deals
	  with the format

2008-12-17 08:43  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_php2po.py: Fix newline test to follow new escaping
	  rules.

2008-12-17 08:35  winterstream

	* convert/po2symb, convert/po2symb.py, convert/symb2po,
	  convert/symb2po.py, convert/symb_common.py: Added basic
	  converters to convert from Symbian-like translation formats
	  to PO and vice versa. The format is heavily biased towards the
	  way that
	  the Buddycloud translation files look.

2008-12-17 08:33  winterstream

	* misc/quote.py: Replace the old horrid extractwithoutquotes with a
	  more maintainable version.

2008-12-16 16:15  friedelwolff

	* services/tmserver.py: +Docstring. -unused variables. Whitespace
	  cleanup.

2008-12-15 18:29  clouserw

	* convert/po2tiki, convert/po2tiki.py, convert/test_po2tiki.py,
	  convert/test_tiki2po.py, convert/tiki2po, convert/tiki2po.py,
	  storage/test_tiki.py, storage/tiki.py: Import tiki2po

2008-12-15 17:59  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Drop default format string.

2008-12-15 15:32  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Add ignore rules for KDE

2008-12-15 14:55  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_odf2po.py: Another removal of obsolete ODF support.
	  (bug 608)

2008-12-15 14:54  friedelwolff

	* convert/odf2po, convert/odf2po.py, storage/odf.py,
	  storage/test_odf.py: Remove obsolete ODF support. This closes bug
	  608.

2008-12-15 14:44  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2php.py, convert/test_po2php.py: Preserve inline
	  comments in the PHP file. Fixes bug 590.

2008-12-15 14:37  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2php.py: Remove unused variable

2008-12-15 10:45  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py, services/tmserver.py: handle http errors

2008-12-15 10:25  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: s/rewrite/ignore/

2008-12-15 10:11  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py: lost commit

2008-12-15 09:40  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py, storage/test_php.py: Don't back convert real \n
	  to \\n
	  This allows us to, as best we can, preserve layout of multiline
	  entries.

2008-12-15 09:21  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py, storage/test_php.py: Fix bug 589 and escaped \'
	  character in a double quote string.

2008-12-15 08:51  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py, storage/test_php.py: Implement full escaping
	  functionality for PHP. We now treat single and double
	  quote escaping differently as PHP does. The tests all pass but
	  this has not
	  been widely tested on files in the field.
	  
	  This solves most, if not all, of bug 593

2008-12-15 08:46  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: no more 404s on punctuation

2008-12-14 18:46  winterstream

	* storage/pypo.py: Making allcomments a property saves us yet
	  another few cycles.

2008-12-14 18:45  winterstream

	* storage/pypo.py, storage/test_pypo.py: First, having
	  
	  if target == self.target:
	  
	  in gettarget slows things down enormously, since self.target is
	  not that cheap.
	  
	  When I removed this, I uncovered a bug in a test. That's fixed
	  now.
	  
	  This also pointed to a bit of incompleteness in setsource, which
	  is now fixed.
	  
	  Finally, we don't have to call settarget in the constructor,
	  since the base
	  class does it.

2008-12-14 18:44  winterstream

	* storage/base.py, storage/pypo.py: Suprisingly, not using super,
	  makes a tangible speed difference.

2008-12-14 18:43  winterstream

	* storage/poparser.py: Optimized a few if clauses so that common
	  cases are in the if part.

2008-12-14 13:31  winterstream

	* storage/poparser.py: Make the decode process more C-like, since
	  we want to use this
	  with Cython.

2008-12-14 13:30  winterstream

	* storage/poparser.py: Avoid looking up methods dynamically every
	  time.
	  
	  The string and list methods we constantly use are stored
	  at the top of the file in variables. This speeds up
	  processing somewhat.

2008-12-14 13:29  winterstream

	* storage/poparser.py: The readcallback added a lot of unnecessary
	  overhead and
	  we only used it to build a buffer when reading the first
	  unit, so that we could reparse the buffer. But why don't
	  we just read the first unit as a str and then decode all
	  fields in the unit when we get to know the encoding?

2008-12-13 12:07  friedelwolff

	* storage/poparser.py, storage/pypo.py: Replace the old PO parser
	  with a cleaner one by Wynand. This should make maintenance and
	  optimisation easier.

2008-12-13 11:57  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_po.py, storage/test_pypo.py, tools/test_pomerge.py:
	  Some more tests for PO parsing. We don't want to keep lonely
	  comments disassociated anymore. They are joined with the
	  following unit like gettext does.

2008-12-13 07:33  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: Ask lxml not to convert CDATA to raw XML (only
	  available from lxml 2.1.0). This fixes bug 458.

2008-12-13 04:50  friedelwolff

	* misc/textwrap.py: Let % be a wrapping character as well. This
	  brings our PO wrapping closer to gettext and closes bug 622.

2008-12-12 19:17  winterstream

	* convert/xliff2odf.py, storage/odf_io.py: Modified xliff2odf to
	  embed the XLIFF file in the output ODF container.

2008-12-12 17:11  clouserw

	* convert/test_convert.py: Fix bug 624; tests fail if psyco library

2008-12-12 15:58  friedelwolff

	* tests/odf_xliff/test_odf_xliff.py: Printing a unified diff when

2008-12-12 15:17  alaaosh

	* services/tmserver.py: random delay was only needed for testing

2008-12-12 15:15  alaaosh

	* services/restclient.py, services/tmclient.py,
	  services/tmserver.py: CRUD REST and all that jazz

2008-12-12 10:56  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py, storage/test_po.py: Only allow KDE style (msgid)
	  comments right at the start of a line next to the quote
	  character. This fixes bug 625.

2008-12-12 10:46  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Handle addunit more carefully to ensure we call
	  the base class' .addunit

2008-12-11 15:33  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Minor: simple layout fix in list

2008-12-11 15:31  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Add a number of plural forms from
	  http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/l10n/pluralforms

2008-12-06 11:41  dupuy

	* misc/file_discovery.py, tools/poterminology.py: propagate
	  winterstream's r9062 changes to poterminology from 1.2 branch to
	  trunk
	  
	  winterstream * r9062 /src/branches/Pootle-toolkit-1.2/translate/
	  (misc/file_discovery.py tools/poterminology.py):
	  find_installed_file doesn't work under all conditions. So I moved
	  get_abs_data_filename from virtaal into the toolkit.
	  get_abs_data_filename works correctly for all our current cases.

2008-12-04 06:50  clouserw

	* misc/wStringIO.py: Fix TypeError; bug 623

2008-12-01 13:23  winterstream

	* misc/contextlib.py: Modified contextlib.py so that a yield won't
	  appear inside a try,
	  finally clause.
	  
	  This is a limitation of Python 2.4 and we had to make similar
	  changes to
	  contextlib.py before to accomodate Python 2.4.
	  
	  For this reason also there are some limits as to what can be done
	  with
	  context blocks in Python 2.4.

2008-12-01 12:39  friedelwolff

	* lang/te.py: Add basic module for Telugu (te) to disable
	  capitalisation checks

2008-12-01 10:39  friedelwolff

	* lang/bn.py: Add basic module for Bengali (bn) to disable
	  capitalisation checks

2008-12-01 10:06  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/extract.py: Oops, forgot to update the code
	  in extract.py, so that it won't
	  use unit.placeable_id.
	  
	  Now xid assignments should work.

2008-12-01 09:52  winterstream

	* storage/base.py, storage/lisa.py, storage/placeables/base.py: The
	  idea of having a separated PlaceableId structure for
	  units, which would contain and xid and rid, was not going
	  to work well.
	  
	  Now, xid and rid are properties of the unit classes which
	  do nothing unless overridden.

2008-11-28 14:24  winterstream

	* misc/rich.py, tools/podebug.py: Modified podebug to work with
	  rich sources and targets.
	  
	  It will now respect placeables in XLIFF files.

2008-11-28 13:12  winterstream

	* storage/base.py, storage/lisa.py, storage/test_po.py,
	  storage/test_xliff.py, storage/xml_extract/extract.py: Most
	  importantly, moved the rich source and text functionality
	  into the unit bass class.
	  
	  This prompted the need for plurals, something which wasn't taken
	  into account before. Now the rich sources and targets are lists
	  of
	  lists of chunks.
	  
	  Thus
	  [['a', X('42')] <- First string
	  ['foo', G('43', 'baz')]] <- Second string

2008-11-28 13:11  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/extract.py: Added a bit of ad-hoc guard code
	  to find_translatable_dom_nodes
	  to ensure that we avoid processing things like XML processing
	  instructions.

2008-11-28 13:10  winterstream

	* storage/placeables/base.py: Fixed the __repr__ and __unicode__
	  conversions for placeables and
	  added comments.

2008-11-28 07:20  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2html.py: add an option to optionally not use tidy if
	  installed

2008-11-27 09:45  friedelwolff

	* convert/prop2po.py: Properly handle 'discard' units (with
	  DONT_TRANSLATE comments). This fixes bug 619.

2008-11-26 14:31  friedelwolff

	* storage/xml_name.py: Fix a few typos

2008-11-26 13:54  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/generate.py, storage/xml_extract/misc.py,
	  storage/xml_extract/test_misc.py, storage/xml_name.py: Replaced
	  full_xml_name with XmlNamer (which does the same task).

2008-11-26 13:53  winterstream

	* convert/xliff2odf.py: The XPathTree produced by
	  unit_tree.build_unit_tree contains
	  XML names using shortcut names (such as
	  'office:document-content').
	  XmlNamer returns fully qualified XML names, so obviously it
	  won't work where we're trying to reference the short names.

2008-11-26 13:52  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/generate.py: Python warned me about
	  
	  unit.target_dom or unit.source_dom
	  
	  And rightfully so, since it's bad style. Replaced this with an
	  if block.

2008-11-26 10:22  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/misc.py: XML namespaces can include URLs,
	  which means that the regular
	  expression for parsing them must accept the "/" character.

2008-11-26 09:57  winterstream

	* convert/xliff2odf.py: Added other ODF filetypes to xliff2odf.

2008-11-26 09:52  winterstream

	* convert/odf2xliff.py, convert/xliff2odf.py, storage/odf_io.py:
	  Modified odf2xliff to use meta.xml and styles.xml in
	  addition to content.xml when extracting translatable
	  strings.
	  
	  Moved some ODF routines into odf_io.py.

2008-11-25 17:13  winterstream

	* convert/xliff2odf.py, storage/xml_name.py: Modified xliff2odf to
	  work not only on content.xml, but also
	  meta.xml and styles.xml.
	  
	  Added the XmlNamer class to make working with fully qualified
	  XML names a bit less of a pain.

2008-11-25 08:38  alaaosh

	* storage/test_dtd.py: test for bug #610

2008-11-25 08:04  friedelwolff

	* storage/factory.py: If we are creating a new store, keep the
	  filename so that store.save() will work correctly later on

2008-11-24 16:38  alaaosh

	* storage/dtd.py: fixed bug #610 HACKISH

2008-11-24 08:46  friedelwolff

	* misc/optrecurse.py: Play safe to ensure we test correctly for
	  psyco's presence even if the module doesn't exist

2008-11-21 22:24  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2php.py: Refactor: 1/0 -> True/False

2008-11-21 22:24  dwaynebailey

	* convert/php2po.py: Remove remnant of header preservation code.

2008-11-21 22:21  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2prop.py, convert/prop2po.py: Refactor: 1/0 ->
	  True/False

2008-11-21 22:15  dwaynebailey

	* storage/pypo.py: Rafactor: 1/0 -> True/False

2008-11-21 21:53  dwaynebailey

	* storage/dtd.py: Refactor: 1/0 -> True/False

2008-11-21 21:43  dwaynebailey

	* storage/dtd.py: Refactor: change 1/0 to True/False

2008-11-21 21:40  dwaynebailey

	* storage/dtd.py: Refactor. remove continual redifining of
	  self.units which is already defined in base.py

2008-11-21 15:20  friedelwolff

	* storage/qph.py: Ensure we output QPH files like Qt Linguist does
	  it, always with a <!DOCTYPE QPH>. This is a similar workaround
	  used in the new ts class to work around a bug in lxml that was
	  fixed in lxml 2.1.3

2008-11-21 13:41  friedelwolff

	* misc/optrecurse.py: Don't add psyco options if psyco is not
	  installed. This closes bug 606.

2008-11-21 12:16  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Spelling fix

2008-11-20 15:25  alaaosh

	* tools/pretranslate.py: fill origin attribute when adding
	  alt-trans

2008-11-20 10:18  alaaosh

	* tools/pretranslate.py: when in xliff do as the xliffians do nad
	  add fuzzy matches to alt-trans

2008-11-20 10:12  alaaosh

	* storage/xliff.py: addalttrans should support adding source tags
	  and match-quality attributes

2008-11-19 20:52  dwaynebailey

	* storage/dtd.py: Refactor, place functions on seperate lines.

2008-11-19 20:48  dwaynebailey

	* storage/dtd.py: Refactor DTD validation into its own method.

2008-11-19 16:56  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/extract.py, storage/xml_extract/generate.py,
	  storage/xml_extract/misc.py, storage/xml_extract/test_misc.py:
	  Use the XML namespace table to create shorter X-Paths for XLIFF
	  ids.

2008-11-19 16:55  winterstream

	* storage/base.py, storage/placeables/base.py,
	  storage/xml_extract/extract.py, storage/xml_extract/generate.py,
	  storage/xml_extract/misc.py: Sorry for the intertwined changes,
	  but it was hard to separate them.
	  
	  1. Fixed type declarations
	  2. Removed unnecessary bookkeeping code, like the 'level' member
	  in
	  the ParseState structure.
	  3. Moved reduce_unit_tree to extract.py (so it can be close to
	  Translatable class)
	  4. Removed make_translatable (since it is unnecessary)
	  5. ID values for placeables are now computed while walking the
	  Translatable tree, thanks to the IdMaker class.

2008-11-19 16:54  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/extract.py: If we see a tag which is not in
	  our inline namespace,
	  then we should assume that it is not inline (this sounds
	  obvious here, but you'll have to trust me that it's a
	  bit more subtle than that).

2008-11-18 18:44  dwaynebailey

	* storage/dtd.py: Remove unused rewrap function

2008-11-18 18:27  dwaynebailey

	* storage/csvl10n.py, storage/dtd.py, storage/oo.py,
	  storage/php.py, storage/properties.py, storage/pypo.py: Remove
	  various __main__. They where originally intended to allow quick
	  testing of the
	  storage format. BUt nobody uses them and they're not maintained.
	  So lets rather
	  drop them.

2008-11-18 17:54  dwaynebailey

	* misc/optrecurse.py, misc/test_optrecurse.py: Document fn
	  splitext. Add optrecurse test file and test slitext fDocument fn.

2008-11-18 17:34  dwaynebailey

	* doc/epydoc-config.ini, doc/gen_api_docs.sh: Add scripts and
	  config to generate epydoc documentation

2008-11-18 07:57  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: Update comment about lxml versions having a
	  problem outputting the doctype

2008-11-17 19:47  dwaynebailey

	* misc/optrecurse.py: Refactor, move multiple functions on a line
	  to seperate lines.

2008-11-17 19:40  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2dtd.py: Consolidate calls to removeinvalidamps

2008-11-17 19:39  dwaynebailey

	* storage/dtd.py: Refactor removeinvalidamp

2008-11-17 19:37  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Flesh out tests for removeinvalidamp

2008-11-17 19:36  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2dtd.py, convert/test_po2dtd.py, storage/dtd.py,
	  storage/test_dtd.py: Move fn removeinvalidamps from po2dtd into
	  dtd storage class.

2008-11-17 19:27  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Test to see that we raise a warning when we
	  have broken DTD entries.

2008-11-17 19:26  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_base.py: Enable exception testing through warnings
	  to be reset during teardown and setup of storage tests.

2008-11-17 19:18  dwaynebailey

	* lang/__init__.py, lang/common.py: Cleanup lang module
	  documentation

2008-11-17 13:07  alaaosh

	* storage/xliff.py: merged units with matching source should be
	  marked unfuzzy

2008-11-17 12:58  alaaosh

	* convert/pot2po.py: never commit before testing (mistyped function
	  names)

2008-11-17 11:02  alaaosh

	* convert/pot2po.py, convert/test_pot2po.py: refactored pot2po, now
	  supports multiple formats

2008-11-17 10:38  alaaosh

	* storage/lisa.py, storage/pocommon.py, storage/poheader.py,
	  storage/poxliff.py: makeheader should live in poheader instead of
	  pocommon to work with poxliff

2008-11-17 10:32  alaaosh

	* filters/checks.py, filters/pofilter.py: add drupal support

2008-11-17 07:41  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: There are more embarrassing things I am
	  sure.

2008-11-13 15:05  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/extract.py: placeable_name was changed from
	  an array to a string, but this one
	  site still assumed it was an array. This should be fixed now.

2008-11-13 15:04  winterstream

	* misc/typecheck/mixins.py, misc/typecheck/sets.py: Converted
	  relative imports in the typecheck package to
	  fully qualified imports.

2008-11-13 13:51  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Um... logic crock - back to programmer
	  school.

2008-11-13 06:48  friedelwolff

	* lang/kn.py: New class for Kannada (kn) to disable capitalisation
	  checks

2008-11-12 17:48  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Adapt dialect description to correct
	  problems with csv pre Python 2.5. We retain
	  2.5 behaviour and only adjust on older version, so that we can
	  protect most
	  users from potential brokenness.

2008-11-12 15:34  alaaosh

	* tools/pretranslate.py: now works with xliff

2008-11-12 14:37  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Default to using Latin1 instead of UTF-16.
	  We had the problem that in po2wordfast we always produce UTF-16
	  files.
	  This was because the wordfast files where initiated to be utf-16
	  (we only did the right thing if we parsed an
	  existing wordfast file).
	  
	  We do proper detection of the need for UTF-16 in __str__, so
	  rather use Latin1 as the default.

2008-11-12 08:10  alaaosh

	* storage/xliff.py: make xliffunit.merge() match pounit.merge()

2008-11-12 07:54  alaaosh

	* tools/pretranslate.py: fixes #602 still ugly coupling between
	  pot2po and pretranslate

2008-11-12 06:21  dwaynebailey

	* convert/roundtrip-OOo: Remove all traces of wget

2008-11-11 10:29  alaaosh

	* convert/pot2po.py, tools/pretranslate, tools/pretranslate.py,
	  tools/test_pretranslate.py: split pretranslation code from pot2po

2008-11-11 04:08  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_wordfast.py: Fix epydoc by using raw string

2008-11-10 17:26  dwaynebailey

	* storage/qph.py: Provide a refence to the Qt Linguist implemention
	  of .qph, its thebest thing short of a valid DTD.

2008-11-10 14:09  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_poheader.py: Remove failing timezone tests (DST
	  settings probably changed)

2008-11-10 07:57  dwaynebailey

	* convert/__init__.py: Add epydoc groups for clarity

2008-11-10 07:55  dwaynebailey

	* storage/__init__.py: Add epydoc groups for clarity.

2008-11-10 07:53  dwaynebailey

	* __init__.py: Add __version__ to the Misc. group

2008-11-10 07:49  dwaynebailey

	* __init__.py: Add epydoc groups to make it easier to distinguish
	  between various modules.

2008-11-09 14:18  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: Privatise several methods, remove dead code and
	  add some comments

2008-11-09 13:19  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: Properly create the name tag of a new context

2008-11-09 13:17  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: temporarily fix a non-unicode assignment test

2008-11-09 13:12  friedelwolff

	* storage/qph.py: Somewhat simplify qph - a simple implementation
	  for a simple format

2008-11-08 10:14  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py, storage/pypo.py: Align behaviour of addnote for
	  both PO implementations: we don't add comments unless there are
	  non-spacing characters.

2008-11-08 10:04  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_po.py: Rewrite posource of obsolete units to the way
	  that it should actually be output (pypo maintains it either way,
	  but cpo doesn't)

2008-11-08 09:55  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Don't pass obsolete parameter to unquotefrompo
	  (removed in r7417)

2008-11-07 15:45  dwaynebailey

	* convert/dtd2po.py, convert/po2dtd.py, storage/dtd.py: Move
	  labelsuffixes and accesskeysuffixes to dtd.py

2008-11-07 09:11  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_php2po.py: Don't do fancy comment manipulation. This
	  aligns the test with the
	  changes to allow us to take multiline comments from PHP files.

2008-11-06 15:00  dwaynebailey

	* convert/roundtrip-OOo: Lets do XLIFF also

2008-11-06 14:30  dwaynebailey

	* convert/roundtrip-OOo: Lots of cleanups and make it use curl not
	  wget

2008-11-06 10:45  dwaynebailey

	* storage/placeables, storage/xml_extract: Ignore *.pyc

2008-11-06 09:38  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Add a swedish chef rewrite test. Mostly to
	  ensure it
	  continues to work.

2008-11-06 09:34  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Add test for unicode rewrite function

2008-11-06 09:32  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Add tests for blank and en rewrite rules

2008-11-06 09:27  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Add comments to ignore_gtk test

2008-11-06 09:26  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Add tests for xxx rewrite style

2008-11-06 09:14  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_podebug.py: Add a test for ignoring certain GTK
	  messages.

2008-11-06 07:00  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Add gtk as a type of application. Pass whole
	  units to
	  the application ignore function.

2008-11-06 06:51  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Protect line endings. Could probably be better
	  abstracted but good enough for now.

2008-11-03 14:03  walter_l

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Augmented
	  TestDTD.test_entitityreference_in_source() with a test for bug
	  597.

2008-11-03 14:03  walter_l

	* storage/dtd.py: Fixed a bug where multi-line external parameter
	  entities cause the rest of the .dtd file to be parsed
	  incorrectly.

2008-10-31 14:37  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py: We canhandle block comments now

2008-10-31 14:36  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py, storage/test_php.py: Correctly ignore block
	  comments fixes bug 587

2008-10-31 14:27  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_php.py: Split the escaping tests into a single and
	  double quote version

2008-10-31 14:26  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py: Store the escape type in the phpunit

2008-10-31 13:48  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py: Add documentation for the escaping rule reference
	  in the PHP encode and decode functions.

2008-10-31 12:52  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py: Fix typo

2008-10-31 12:50  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py: Improve PHP documentation

2008-10-30 13:29  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/generate.py: Modified xliff2odf to make use
	  of the newly exposed source_dom
	  and target_dom properties of LISA units.
	  
	  This means that we're quite far to supporting placeables
	  properly.

2008-10-29 16:52  winterstream

	* storage/xml_extract/extract.py: Added proper placeable support in
	  the ODF->XLIFF direction
	  (i.e. for odf2xliff).

2008-10-29 16:51  winterstream

	* storage/lisa.py: Refactored source and target accessors in
	  lisa.py so that common
	  functionality is maintained in get_source_dom, set_source_dom,
	  get_target_dom and set_target_dom.
	  
	  This was done, since we are going to use these accessors to
	  restructure
	  a template (such as an ODF file) in accordance with how
	  placeables
	  differ between the source and target.

2008-10-29 06:55  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2php.py: Remove debug output.

2008-10-29 06:53  dwaynebailey

	* storage/php.py: Improve documentation after research for bug 589

2008-10-28 15:58  winterstream

	* storage/placeables/misc.py: Forgot to add this file earlier.
	  Sorry!

2008-10-28 15:36  winterstream

	* convert/test_po2html.py: Fixed another test. The expected output

	* storage/placeables/__init__.py, storage/placeables/base.py,
	  storage/placeables/lisa.py, storage/placeables/test_lisa.py,
	  storage/test_xliff.py: In the process of replacing placeables
	  support for the toolkit.
	  
	  The toolkit's placeable support is based on XLIFF's placeables.
	  There are structures defined for all of the XLIFF placeables.
	  
	  The support is currently limited. We don't properly support
	  marked content yet. We also don't enforce constraints such
	  as that <sub> tags cannot be children of <g> tags. This will
	  all follow in the future.
	  
	  This patch includes placeable support for the LISA store types.
	  The accessors get_rich_source and set_rich_source are used to
	  set the source of a unit with placeables. Likewise the
	  accessors get_rich_target and set_rich_target are used to
	  access the target of a unit.
	  
	  See the unit tests for how these should be used.

	* storage/xml_extract/misc.py: Fixed the tag regex to deal with

	* storage/placeables/baseplaceables.py,
	  storage/placeables/chunk.py,
	  storage/placeables/lisaplaceables.py,
	  storage/placeables/test_chunk.py: 1. Added the class attribute
	  'type' which is used to distinguish
	  between placeables. We use the XLIFF specification's
	  characterization
	  of different types of placeables (see the comments in the code).
	  2. Added a chunk list type which will be used to set placeables
	  for units.
	  Units should also return chunk types through the attributes
	  marked_source and marked_target.
	  3. Added some tests for the chunk type.

2008-10-28 10:18  winterstream

	* storage/placeables/baseplaceables.py: Fixed source errors in the

	  The ODF type encapsulates an ODF file. It defines equality on
	  such files

	* storage/test_rc.py: Add basic rest for escaping.

2008-10-16 12:40  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py, tools/pocount.py: Fixed possible stats
	  database inconsistency problems. Also modified
	  statsdb never to catch any exceptions. The user code must handle
	  exceptions.
	  
	  In the previous code, if an error occurred before a database
	  commit
	  was issued, then a next database commit would pull in possibly
	  inconsistent changes from the previous failed call.
	  
	  To ensure consistency, the database MUST be rolled back if ANY
	  exception, whatsoever is raised in the database code. Why?
	  Because
	  it's impossible to know whether the database state is consistent
	  at the point when an exception is thrown.
	  
	  The transaction decorator will ensure a database commit if
	  a decorated function executes without problems. Otherwise (if
	  an exception occured), it will roll back the database and
	  reraise the exception.
	  
	  Also note that pocount now handles exceptions from statsdb.

	* tests/odf_xliff/test_2-test_odf2xliff-reference.xlf,

	  both the translate toolkit and itools as their engines.

	* convert/odf2xliff.py, misc/contextlib.py: Integrated a patch from
	  David Versmisse (from Itaapy) to use itools
	  as the ODF extraction engine.
	  
	  Now a user can convert a document from ODF to XLIFF using either
	  itools or the translate toolkit using the flag --engine=itools
	  or --engine=toolkit.

	  storage/odf_shared.py to attempt first to import itools and to
	  use
	  its ODF information. Failing that, it falls back to a copy of the
	  itools
	  information in storage/odf_shared.py (which may be out of date).
	  
	  The important change is that we initially listed the tags in
	  which we
	  were interested, whereas itools lists tags that should be
	  ignored.
	  
	  Due to integration of the code with itools, the specification
	  mechanism
	  has also been simplified. We only have a table of tags we reject
	  and a
	  table of inline placeables.

	  This is a rather massive commit.
	  
	  The code includes cleanups, as well as a mechanism to reorder
	  placeables in an arbitrary fashion.
	  
	  The next step is to break this into a package and to add
	  comments,
	  since the code is very dense.

	  Made the behaviour of apply_translations post-fix. This is so
	  ensure that
	  child nodes are processed before parent nodes.
	  
	  Why?
	  
	  Because we might re-order the child nodes (depending on whether
	  the
	  translator re-ordered placeables) and therefore we must FIRST
	  deal with children, since we use XPath-like identifiers to find
	  children.

	  Pilfered Python 2.5's contextlib which simplifies the context
	  quite nicely and should make it easier to upgrade our code
	  to Python 2.5+ in the future.

	  replace_dom_text will take apart the translated text in unit,
	  discover which parts are placeables and which are not, and modify
	  the text in the dom node, and the tail text of the children of
	  the
	  dom node.
	  
	  In other words, this is what pulls a translation from a unit and
	  updates the DOM accordingly.

	  Fixes to get plural entries working in virtaal:
	  * Add list of languages and plural forms, include reference to
	  source. This might be better placed
	  in lang/data.py but since it is hard coded for all of Qt this is
	  probably a better spot.
	  * Implement getsource: this allows us to force the source into a
	  multistring, in .ts the source
	  will always be a single entry never multiple as in PO. With this
	  the generic hasplural will work
	  * Add decorators for source and target, seems we get the parent
	  ones if not added
	  * Add nplural fuction to find the language and return the number
	  of plural forms
	  * Retrieve the nplural value if we are editing a .ts store.

	  quote.extractstr is called very often. The underlying function is
	  quite heavyweight and adds quite a bit of runtime overhead.
	  
	  And yet, all we need is to find the left " (the quote) and the
	  right
	  " in a string and to return a string with the quotes intact. This
	  is done much faster as done in the new little extractstr
	  implementation
	  in pypo.py.

	  1. Change the members 'keys' and 'values' in Record to
	  'record_keys'
	  and 'record_values', so as to avoid confusion with the methods
	  named 'keys' and 'values'.
	  
	  2. Added the callback compute_derived_values to Record, so that
	  it
	  can compute values which are derived from its other values and
	  keep these up to date. The class FileTotals makes use of this;
	  the method FileTotals._compute_derived_values computes values for
	  "total", "totalsourcewords" and "review" from the values
	  retrieved
	  from the database.
	  
	  3. Renamed OTHER to UNTRANSLATED.
	  
	  4. Renamed Record.db_repr to Record.as_string_for_db.
	  
	  5. Updated get_unit_stats to retrieve targetwords from the
	  database,
	  since FileTotals now also requires this value.
	  
	  6. Changed the values stored inside the database.
	  
	  7. Bumped up the toolkit build number.

	  If we bump up the toolkit's version number, we delete the current
	  stats
	  cache database, if it has an old version number.
	  
	  This is not ideal and in the future, we'll probably name stats
	  cache
	  database files differently as we change the database layout, so
	  that
	  multiple versions of the toolkit software will be able to
	  coexist.

	  occurrences of a given tag (so that it can give an index to a
	  tag).
	  
	  We now also store the full XPath of a translatable as a string,
	  which we get from the breadcrumb.

	  Thus, when we hit a tag, we check whether it appears in
	  the placeable_table. If so, we push a name onto the placeable
	  stack.

	  This is some fairly dense code to extract XML from an arbitrary
	  document,
	  given tables of
	  1. XML namespaces which should be converted, and
	  2. XML namespaces which should appear as placables within other
	  translatable hunks.
	  
	  The code works by searching through the DOM tree (the function
	  apply),
	  until it hits a translatable tag. Then it calls
	  process_translatable_tag.
	  
	  process_translatable_tag sees whether there are any
	  sub-translatable
	  tags in the current translatable tag. An example of this is
	  footnotes
	  in OpenOffice.org documents. The XML code for a footnote appears
	  within
	  the paragraph tag with which the footnote is associated. Or in
	  XML:
	  
	  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">First. This should
	  <text:note text:id="ftn0" text:note-class="footnote">
	  <text:note-citation>1</text:note-citation>
	  <text:note-body>
	  <text:p text:style-name="Footnote">Footnote 1</text:p>
	  </text:note-body>
	  </text:note>not be segmented. Even with etc. and so.
	  </text:p>
	  
	  We need to treat tags like <text:note> as placables, which means
	  that
	  the above should be presented to the translator as something
	  like:
	  
	  First. This should&footnote_1; not be segmented. Even with etc.
	  and so.
	  
	  Note that the entire XML block related to the footnote is
	  represented
	  by:
	  
	  &footnote_1;
	  
	  Thus, process_translatable_tag is responsible for finding any
	  placables
	  in the current translatable_tag. If there are any placables, it
	  should
	  create placable tags for them (such as &footnote_1;) and
	  construct a
	  translatable string containing these placable tags. Then it
	  proceeds to
	  deal with the children (that is, the placables) by invoking apply
	  on them.
	  
	  Note that the current implementation uses the Record type, which
	  provides
	  immutable records (for stateless programming). Because it is
	  immutable,
	  every modification creates a new record.

	  Immutable record type from
	  http://www.valuedlessons.com/2007/12/immutable-data-in-python-record-or.html
	  (author's name not found).
	  
	  This is useful for stateless code.

	  odf_shared.py contains the information needed by the XML parser
	  to
	  extract translatables and placables from ODF documents.
	  
	  The information is derived from itools, as indicated in the
	  comments.

2008-10-08 19:40  dwaynebailey

	* storage/csvl10n.py, storage/qm.py: Add filetype names for .qm and
	  our brand of CSV.

2008-10-07 22:47  dwaynebailey

	* convert/ical2po.py, convert/ini2po.py, convert/rc2po.py: Revert
	  r8712: broke the conversion even though it isn't used. Refactor
	  at
	  a later stage.

2008-10-07 22:26  dwaynebailey

	* convert/ical2po.py, convert/ini2po.py: Remove unused xliff import

2008-10-07 22:21  dwaynebailey

	* convert/ical2po.py, convert/ini2po.py, convert/rc2po.py:
	  commenttype is never used

2008-10-07 21:31  dwaynebailey

	* convert/rc2po.py: CAPITALISE a constant

2008-10-07 21:19  dwaynebailey

	* convert/rc2po.py: Align terminology

2008-10-07 20:36  dwaynebailey

	* convert/ical2po.py, convert/ini2po.py: Align naming

2008-10-07 16:31  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py, convert/dtd2po.py, convert/po2dtd.py,
	  convert/test_accesskey.py: Change accesskey function names to
	  something more readable:
	  get_label_and_accesskey => extract
	  combine_label_accesskey => combine

2008-10-07 16:28  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py, convert/dtd2po.py,
	  convert/test_accesskey.py: Move the accesskey+label combining
	  functionaity out of dtd2po and into
	  the generic accesskey module. Adjust dtd2po to use this function.
	  Include tests for the combining.

2008-10-07 16:22  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py, convert/po2dtd.py,
	  convert/test_accesskey.py: Remove the getlabel and getacceskey
	  functions. We'd rather use the combined function.
	  po2dtd.py is adapted with some unused variables, these will
	  probably disappear as we
	  refactor that code.

2008-10-07 16:19  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py, convert/test_accesskey.py: Deal with the
	  empty string

2008-10-07 16:18  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py, convert/test_accesskey.py: Make everything
	  Unicode. There are some asserts which should probably be removed
	  in the future.

2008-10-07 16:16  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py: Merge functions from getlabel and
	  getaccesskey into get_label_and_accesskey. They were mostly
	  identical anyway.

2008-10-07 16:14  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py, convert/test_accesskey.py: Create a
	  combined function that returns botht the label and accesskey

2008-10-07 16:12  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py, convert/test_accesskey.py: Allow the
	  accesskeyto be specified, also set default to '&'

2008-10-07 16:10  dwaynebailey

	* convert/accesskey.py, convert/po2dtd.py,
	  convert/test_accesskey.py: Move getlabel and getaccesskey
	  functions out into its own module. Provide tests. Adjust
	  po2dtd.py to use the new module.

2008-10-07 16:04  dwaynebailey

	* convert/oo2po.py, convert/oo2xliff.py, convert/po2oo.py,
	  convert/xliff2oo.py, storage/oo.py, storage/test_oo.py: Move the
	  4 makekey functions into the storage class. Create a test to
	  validate that it works.

2008-10-07 15:36  dupuy

	* .cvsignore: ignore generated files

2008-10-07 12:23  friedelwolff

	* convert/pot2po.py: Massive renaming to clarify store vs file.
	  Also got rid of several PO references.

2008-10-07 12:00  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Use unicode literals - this provides a small
	  speedup, and is just good in general

2008-10-06 13:03  friedelwolff

	* ChangeLog: Update ChangeLog before the release of 1.2.0

2008-10-06 12:58  friedelwolff

	* __version__.py: Version 1.2.0

2008-10-06 12:37  friedelwolff

	* CREDITS: Credit Miklos for work on version control

2008-10-06 10:14  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Make 100% sure the xliff imported
	  successfully. Pofilter should now work correctly when lxml is not
	  installed.

2008-10-06 10:12  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Deal properly with unicode arguments to
	  exceptions, even for Python 2.3 that doesn't have .args

2008-10-06 09:55  friedelwolff

	* filters/spelling.py: Force the multistring to unicode to avoid
	  problems with Python 2.3 and enchant

2008-10-05 22:34  dwaynebailey

	* storage/ts2.py: Add mimetype for .ts

2008-10-04 13:12  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py: Add a default 'Name' field for the store (to be
	  overridden) and document all store-level variables

2008-10-04 13:11  dwaynebailey

	* storage/mo.py: Improve docstring. Point to the Gettext
	  information on MO and say something
	  about hashing.

2008-10-04 13:08  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py, storage/mo.py, storage/qm.py: Use a variable
	  _binary in the store to indicate if file access should be binary
	  (non-binary by default, overridden for mo and qm). This fixes bug
	  538.

2008-10-03 11:53  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: The stats database code checks to see whether
	  the database
	  version matches the current toolkit build and deletes the
	  database if it does not.
	  
	  If however the database is empty, this cannot be verified.
	  
	  The database layout needs to be fixed though. We'll do that
	  later. This patch should fix things in the mean time.

2008-10-02 22:40  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Cast multistring to plain unicode to simplify
	  things. Ensure failures have unicode messages. Fix incorrectly
	  ordered parameters

2008-10-02 12:13  friedelwolff

	* storage/qph.py: Remove methods that override methods that work
	  fine in the parent class. This fixes bug 533.

2008-10-02 12:12  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: Ensure source and target is always unicode

2008-10-01 08:56  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pogrep.py: Catch strings(source/target) that are None and
	  don't try to search them.

2008-10-01 08:54  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: unicodedata.normalize does not accept None so make
	  sure we catch this.

2008-10-01 08:52  dwaynebailey

	* storage/txt.py: Actually use the encoding that we supply in
	  __init__

2008-09-30 20:21  dwaynebailey

	* misc/optrecurse.py, tools/pocount.py: Exclude GIT, Mercurial and
	  Bazaar RCS special directories

2008-09-30 20:17  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pocount.py: Ignore Mercurial and GIT hidden directories.

2008-09-30 19:42  dupuy

	* share/stoplist-en: remove second "second" from comment
	  add 'th' to ordinal number part of regex to ignore/exclude 4th
	  19th 100th

2008-09-30 17:26  dupuy

	* share/stoplist-en: better comments for regexes

2008-09-30 09:43  dupuy

	* tools/poterminology.py: fix proper handling of default stoplist
	  with no -S options that was broken by
	  r8553 (I botched the split-up of the poterminology into
	  "orthogonal" patches)

2008-09-30 07:26  dupuy

	* tools/poterminology.py: change default case mapping behavior to
	  -F/--fold-titlecase
	  add new -C/--preserve-case mapping behavior for old default
	  multiple -C/-F/-I options can now be given, the last one wins

2008-09-30 07:19  dupuy

	* tools/poterminology.py: add new -u/--update argument; file is
	  used for both input and output
	  (currently "-u XXX" is mostly equivalent to "-i XXX -o XXX" but
	  this can
	  be made smarter later on; for now, -u argument does not increase
	  default
	  --inputs-needed to 2) -- only one of -u/-o can be used in any
	  command line
	  refuse to overwrite existing output file implicitly specified by
	  freestanding
	  arguments; this provides protection against shell wildcard
	  expansion accidents

2008-09-30 07:06  dupuy

	* share/stoplist-en: minor adjustments to default stoplist:
	  enhanced self-documenting comments
	  use new case mapping directive to enable title-case folding
	  allow phrases with 'ad' (e.g. 'ad hoc')
	  ignore phrases with 'eg' 'qv' 'vs' 'would'

2008-09-30 07:01  dupuy

	* tools/poterminology.py: support specification of multiple
	  stoplist files
	  enhance format of stoplist file to include case mapping directive
	  (for upper-/title-/lower-case mapping of words before stoplist
	  comparison)

2008-09-29 21:15  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py: Indicate the correct position in the header
	  for the new 'Language' field

2008-09-29 19:04  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: Work around the default output options to align
	  better with Qt .ts defaults. +DOCTYPE, -XML decleration

2008-09-29 17:24  friedelwolff

	* lang/fr.py: Correct the case where URIs were incorrectly spaced
	  for punctuation translation (' ://' -> '://')

2008-09-29 17:23  friedelwolff

	* lang/test_fr.py: Test that URIs are not spaced incorrectly due to
	  punctuation translation

2008-09-29 17:21  friedelwolff

	* lang/common.py: Add a note about plural defaults

2008-09-29 17:20  friedelwolff

	* lang/common.py: Minor tweak for punctuation translation at the
	  end of text. This fixes ellipses for Chinese.

2008-09-29 17:16  friedelwolff

	* lang/test_zh.py: Test some more cases with full stops (.) and
	  ellipses (...)

2008-09-29 15:04  friedelwolff

	* storage/pocommon.py: Add another MIME type
	  'text/x-gettext-translation' as that is currently used by other
	  apps in the ~/.recently_used.xbel

2008-09-29 14:01  friedelwolff

	  escaping

2008-09-27 08:10  dwaynebailey

	* storage/statsdb.py: docstring: Indent correctly and remove stale
	  documentation

2008-09-27 08:07  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_wordfast.py: Fix docstring indentation

2008-09-27 08:05  dwaynebailey

	* storage/versioncontrol/__init__.py: epoydoc cleanups

2008-09-27 07:59  dwaynebailey

	  Word

2008-09-27 07:57  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Add section on encoding

2008-09-27 07:53  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Document UTF-16 tab constant

2008-09-27 07:52  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Add many cross reference to the actual
	  functions

2008-09-27 07:40  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Fix _char_to_wf docstring

2008-09-27 07:35  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Add implementation docstring

2008-09-27 07:15  dwaynebailey

	* storage/ical.py: Add docstring

2008-09-27 06:56  dwaynebailey

	* storage/ical.py: Fix misnamed variable

2008-09-26 14:22  dwaynebailey

	* README: Add notes about vobject for ical2po
	  Add ical2po and ini2po to the list of converters

2008-09-24 20:27  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py: Add accessors to manipulate the
	  targetlanguage of a poheader implementation. This feature will
	  appear in gettext 0.18.

2008-09-24 20:25  friedelwolff

	* storage/poheader.py: When updating a header with plural
	  information, add the Plural-Forms entry if it is not yet there

2008-09-24 16:16  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_ts2.py: Unit tests for the new ts2.py

2008-09-24 14:27  dwaynebailey

	* convert/ical2po, convert/ical2po.py, convert/po2ical,
	  convert/po2ical.py, storage/ical.py: Add iCalendar conversion
	  support:
	  * This uses the vobject library to access .ics files.
	  * We only process relevant text properties in VEVENT objects.
	  We could process other entries but why?
	  * vobject should be >= 0.6.5
	  
	  On a positive note, these where implemented based on ini.py
	  and the limited amount that needed to be implemented for
	  ical.py and po2ical/ical2po highlighted that we are close
	  to making this generic enough that by simply adding a format
	  we get a converter at not extra cost.
	  
	  Happy localising of Calendars!

2008-09-22 16:44  friedelwolff

	* lang/test_or.py: Test that a country code doesn't mix up the
	  factory in the case of special codes (python reserved words)

2008-09-22 14:11  sumpfralle

	* storage/versioncontrol/bzr.py, storage/versioncontrol/hg.py,
	  storage/versioncontrol/svn.py: adding version dependencies for
	  the "author" attribute:
	  * svn: since v1.5
	  * bzr: sinve v0.91
	  * cvs: not supported
	  * darcs: at least since v1.09 according to changelog (this
	  version is in debian
	  stable - thus a check does not seem to be important)
	  * git: since v1.4.3 (this is way older than the package in debian
	  stable, thus
	  a check should not be necessary)
	  * hg: since v1.0

2008-09-21 12:55  dwaynebailey

	* storage/qph.py: Return an empty string if the unit is
	  untranslated

2008-09-21 12:47  dwaynebailey

	* storage/ts2.py: Return an empty string if the translation is
	  empty

2008-09-21 02:11  dwaynebailey

	* storage/ts2.py: Manage empty context name

2008-09-21 01:19  dwaynebailey

	* storage/factory.py, storage/qph.py: Add .qph - Qt Phrase Book
	  support based on ts2

2008-09-20 23:48  dwaynebailey

	* storage/ts2.py: Fixes to get plural entries working in virtaal:
	  * Add list of languages and plural forms, include reference to
	  source. This might be better placed
	  in lang/data.py but since it is hard coded for all of Qt this is
	  probably a better spot.
	  * Implement getsource: this allows us to force the source into a
	  multistring, in .ts the source
	  will always be a single entry never multiple as in PO. With this
	  the generic hasplural will work
	  * Add decorators for source and target, seems we get the parent
	  ones if not added
	  * Add nplural fuction to find the language and return the number
	  of plural forms
	  * Retrieve the nplural value if we are editing a .ts store.

2008-09-20 20:34  friedelwolff

	* storage/factory.py: Add format support for detecting .ts content

2008-09-20 20:20  friedelwolff

	* storage/factory.py: Add support for ts2 as ts

2008-09-20 20:14  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts2.py: Initial support for new Qt linguist (.ts) files

2008-09-20 13:29  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2dtd.py: Update copyright dates

2008-09-20 10:26  dwaynebailey

	* storage/benchmark.py: Remove unused imports

2008-09-20 09:02  dwaynebailey

	* storage/benchmark.py: s/profile/cProfile/

2008-09-19 21:40  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: Ensure that we return unicode strings when
	  dealing using xpath("string()")

2008-09-19 21:39  friedelwolff

	* tools/test_pogrep.py: Bring in something non-ASCII for better
	  testing

2008-09-19 15:32  friedelwolff

	* __version__.py: Version 1.2.0-rc1

2008-09-19 14:59  winterstream

	* storage/pypo.py: quote.extractstr is called very often. The
	  underlying function is
	  quite heavyweight and adds quite a bit of runtime overhead.
	  
	  And yet, all we need is to find the left " (the quote) and the
	  right
	  " in a string and to return a string with the quotes intact. This
	  is done much faster as done in the new little extractstr
	  implementation
	  in pypo.py.

2008-09-19 14:56  winterstream

	* __version__.py, storage/statsdb.py: 1. Change the members 'keys'
	  and 'values' in Record to 'record_keys'
	  and 'record_values', so as to avoid confusion with the methods
	  named 'keys' and 'values'.
	  
	  2. Added the callback compute_derived_values to Record, so that
	  it
	  can compute values which are derived from its other values and
	  keep these up to date. The class FileTotals makes use of this;
	  the method FileTotals._compute_derived_values computes values for
	  "total", "totalsourcewords" and "review" from the values
	  retrieved
	  from the database.
	  
	  3. Renamed OTHER to UNTRANSLATED.
	  
	  4. Renamed Record.db_repr to Record.as_string_for_db.
	  
	  5. Updated get_unit_stats to retrieve targetwords from the
	  database,
	  since FileTotals now also requires this value.
	  
	  6. Changed the values stored inside the database.
	  
	  7. Bumped up the toolkit build number.

2008-09-19 14:44  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: If we bump up the toolkit's version number,
	  we delete the current stats
	  cache database, if it has an old version number.
	  
	  This is not ideal and in the future, we'll probably name stats
	  cache
	  database files differently as we change the database layout, so
	  that
	  multiple versions of the toolkit software will be able to
	  coexist.

	* storage/benchmark.py: Benchmark the creation of files

2008-09-15 10:56  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Add an accessor for the file tag's date
	  attribute

2008-09-15 10:53  friedelwolff

	* filters/test_checks.py: Test that purepunc won't barf on numeric
	  translation with stupid GNOME context markers

2008-09-15 10:51  friedelwolff

	* filters/test_checks.py: Ensure that we fail if a translation
	  contains two accelerators

2008-09-15 10:51  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Rewrite radically to simplify and optimise.
	  Correct the incorrect use of decoration.ispurepunctuation

2008-09-15 10:46  friedelwolff

	* filters/decoration.py: ispurepunctuation() should not be true for
	  numeric strings. Rewrite in more modern style.

2008-09-15 06:41  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: All messages must be unicode (check line 114)

2008-09-12 06:48  dwaynebailey

	* storage/qm.py: Raise and error if our file is to short

2008-09-12 05:03  dwaynebailey

	* storage/mo.py: No need to declare self.units inheritted from
	  base.py

2008-09-12 04:23  dwaynebailey

	* storage/benchmark.py: Remove all the Pootle stuff
	  Make the script format agnostic
	  Allow command line to specify which storage format you want to
	  profile

2008-09-12 04:18  dwaynebailey

	* storage/benchmark.py: Copy old benchmarking script from Pootle

2008-09-11 11:41  dwaynebailey

	* lang/data.py: Add Kyrgyz

2008-09-08 12:59  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: _cacheunitstats adds stats totals, so we
	  should only subtract the
	  value of the old stats in recacheunit.

2008-09-03 19:42  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Added file_fails_test which does a quick test
	  to determine whether
	  any units in a file fail the test passed in the name parameter.
	  
	  Since file_fails_test also needs to ensure that file checks have
	  been run before doing its work, the common code from filechecks
	  was factored out so that both file_fails_test and filechecks can
	  use it.

2008-09-03 19:38  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Store the file totals in the database. This
	  uses a simple
	  ORM scheme and will soon be replaced by something better
	  (from Mozilla).
	  
	  Storing the totals in the database should help to fix some
	  of the out-of-date stats problems that we had.

2008-08-28 16:11  friedelwolff

	* tools/poconflicts.py: Ensure that there is still some source
	  string left after self.flatten(). If there is nothing left (for a
	  string such as '...' we probably want to ignore it anyway.

2008-08-28 06:29  dwaynebailey

	* filters/pofilter.py: Do user expansion of input filename to allow
	  ~ expansion to user home directory.

	  to indexing.

2008-08-26 08:09  winterstream

	* misc/quote.py: dict.fromkeys(lst).keys() is equal to lst, but
	  slower! So we'll just substitute
	  and gain speed!

	* storage/versioncontrol/__init__.py,
	  storage/versioncontrol/cvs.py, storage/versioncontrol/git.py,
	  storage/versioncontrol/git_old.py: versioncontrol interface:
	  * simplify chdir to specific working directories for different
	  VCS
	  (based on a patch of Wynand Winterbach)
	  * remove obsolete "git_old" module

2008-08-25 15:41  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py: Revert r7983 seems those docs just went
	  and disappeared

2008-08-25 15:37  walter_l

	* storage/test_mo.py: Commented out a test-case, because the
	  hash-size is different compared to gettext,
	  since we're not counting untranslated units.

2008-08-25 15:35  walter_l

	* storage/mo.py: Applied sumpfralle's patch
	  (http://bugs.locamotion.org/attachment.cgi?id=214&action=view) to
	  use
	  prime numbers in hashing .mo files.

2008-08-25 15:34  friedelwolff

	* CREDITS: Credit Walter Leibbrandt and Wynand Winterbach

2008-08-25 11:24  walter_l

	* storage/test_mo.py: Fixed .mo test to anticipate the fact that
	  pocompile ignores empty .po files.

2008-08-25 10:58  walter_l

	* storage/test_mo.py: Cosmetic changes - removed unnecessary
	  trailing spaces.

2008-08-22 16:40  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: filetotals should return an empty dictionary
	  if it fails to compute
	  the stats for a file. This is what pocount expects, since
	  otherwise
	  pocount reports stats for non-translation files.

2008-08-21 15:32  friedelwolff

	* __version__.py: up the build number

2008-08-21 15:05  friedelwolff

	* misc/progressbar.py: Fix the example code to run

2008-08-20 15:34  friedelwolff

	* __version__.py: Version 1.2-beta1

2008-08-20 11:36  friedelwolff

	* storage/mo.py: Fix indentation, typo, stale comment about not
	  support hash tables

2008-08-20 10:56  friedelwolff

	* convert/pot2po.py: Increase the length of translations considered
	  for reuse from the old PO file (this does not affect the limits
	  of the TM macher). This mostly fixes bug 346.

2008-08-19 14:51  friedelwolff

	* storage/statsdb.py: Remove the use of collections.defaultdict
	  (only available from Python 2.5)

2008-08-19 09:43  friedelwolff

	* tools/poterminology.py: Support pot files

2008-08-15 15:51  walter_l

	* tools/poterminology.py: Set stopwords-en to be loaded by default
	  in poterminology.py unless -S was specified.

2008-08-15 14:54  walter_l

	* share, share/stoplist-en: Added translate/share and included its
	  content as data files in setup.py.

2008-08-15 12:38  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Renamed emptystats to emptyfiletotals so that
	  there is symmetry in the
	  naming of the functions which return empty stats structures.
	  
	  Let emptyfilechecks return a defaultdict so that other code won't
	  fail
	  when trying to access tests which are non-existant.
	  
	  Finally, directorytotals - which was never used - was removed.

2008-08-15 11:28  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Make matcher a new-style class

2008-08-15 10:38  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_po2xliff.py: Rewrite the testing for the approved
	  attribute slightly to also work with left out attributes (meaning
	  'no' - not approved)

2008-08-15 10:37  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Don't set the approved attribute unnecessarily.
	  Before this could add an approved=no where there was nothing
	  before (defaulting to no according to the XLIFF specification)

2008-08-14 23:36  sumpfralle

	* search/indexer/CommonIndexer.py, search/indexer/test_indexers.py:
	  add support for multiple terms in a field (given as a list)

2008-08-14 23:31  sumpfralle

	* search/indexer/CommonIndexer.py,
	  search/indexer/PyLuceneIndexer.py,
	  search/indexer/PyLuceneIndexer1.py,
	  search/indexer/XapianIndexer.py, search/indexer/test_indexers.py:
	  add support for unicode terms and a corresponding test

2008-08-14 14:33  friedelwolff

	* TESTING: Some notes for testing. See bug 475 for the inspiration.

2008-08-14 14:28  friedelwolff

	* CREDITS: Expand Alexander Dupuy's activities

2008-08-14 14:10  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: [Contributed by Alexander Dupuy] Fix
	  runtests() for testing from __main__.

2008-08-14 14:05  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: [Contributed by Alexander Dupuy] Be more
	  lenient in the simplecaps test. This fixes the currently failing
	  test.

2008-08-14 14:02  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: [Contributed by
	  Alexder Dupuy] Support omitting format specifiers in plural form
	  translations. Check bug 475.

2008-08-14 13:57  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Only support unicode.isupper since input must
	  be unicode strings

2008-08-12 11:36  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: [Contributed by Alexader Dupuy] Return the
	  correct filterresult if a test failed without filtermessages
	  (when no FilterFailure) is raised). See bug 345 for more detail.

2008-08-12 11:33  friedelwolff

	* filters/test_checks.py: Augment the spellcheck test to more
	  deliberately show what we want. The test broke if you happened to
	  have 'Mozilla' in your personal wordlist for aspell for Afrikaans
	  where you execute the tests.

2008-08-08 15:55  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Python <2.5 needs us to be more specific
	  about the dialect options. The missing requirements
	  are now added which should prevent failure in factory.py.

2008-08-06 13:33  dwaynebailey

	* storage/wordfast.py: Add a Wordfast CSV dialect. This solves bug
	  #472.
	  * Wordfast now correctly handles the roundtripping of quoted
	  characters.
	  * It also sorts out a newline issue.

2008-08-05 10:05  dwaynebailey

	* tests/xliff_conformance/test_xliff_conformance.py: Ensure we can
	  run the test from outside of the test directory

2008-08-04 18:09  dwaynebailey

	* storage/properties.py: Update reference to .properties
	  specification

2008-08-04 18:06  dwaynebailey

	* storage/dtd.py: Check the DTD file for validity by parsing it
	  returing __str__

2008-08-04 10:35  winterstream

	* tests/xliff_conformance/test_xliff_conformance.py: Schema
	  validation is now done with lxml's facilities instead of by
	  invoking
	  xmllint.

2008-08-04 10:26  winterstream

	* storage/xliff.py: Modified the XLIFF output to conform to the
	  XLIFF 1.1 schema.

2008-08-04 10:02  dwaynebailey

	* storage/lisa.py, storage/xliff.py: Fix FutureWarning error by
	  using: if elem is not None

2008-08-04 09:14  winterstream

	* tests/xliff_conformance/af-pootle.po,
	  tests/xliff_conformance/test_xliff_conformance.py: Added a test
	  to check the output of po2xliff. Sadly, it currently fails,
	  which means that we're outputtting invalid XLIFF files.

2008-08-04 09:02  winterstream

	* tests, tests/xliff_conformance,
	  tests/xliff_conformance/en-US.sdf,
	  tests/xliff_conformance/test_xliff_conformance.py,
	  tests/xliff_conformance/xliff-core-1.1.xsd: Added a basic
	  functional test to ensure that our tools produce valid
	  XLIFF 1.1 files.
	  
	  Currently, there is only one test, which uses oo2xliff to convert
	  an
	  OpenOffice.org SDF file to a set of XLIFF files. xmllint then
	  checks
	  each of these files against the XLIFF 1.1 Schema.

2008-08-04 08:57  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Create class methods that will return available
	  rewrite functions and ignore rules. Adapt optparse section to use
	  these functions.

2008-08-04 08:54  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Add Unicode rewrite style. This converts all
	  plain ASCII chars to characters in the Unicode range that look
	  the same as the ASCII. This would allow a translator or
	  programmer to build a test translation that can validate the use
	  of Unicode characters in translated strings.

2008-07-24 20:11  friedelwolff

	* lang/data.py: [Contributed by Suresh Chandrasekharan] Move the
	  language matching code from Pootle to the toolkit

2008-07-23 17:09  sumpfralle

	* storage/versioncontrol/svn.py: [Contributed by Daniel Schafer]
	  add versioned svn property "translate:author"

2008-07-21 00:35  sumpfralle

	* storage/versioncontrol/__init__.py,
	  storage/versioncontrol/bzr.py, storage/versioncontrol/cvs.py,
	  storage/versioncontrol/darcs.py, storage/versioncontrol/git.py,
	  storage/versioncontrol/git_old.py, storage/versioncontrol/hg.py,
	  storage/versioncontrol/svn.py: add support for the 'author' tag
	  to various revision control systems (contributed by Miklos Vajna)

2008-07-18 12:40  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Added a default field to emptystats()

2008-07-17 17:46  winterstream

	* storage/test_statsdb.py: Updated the statsdb test to reflect the
	  change in the database layout

2008-07-17 17:45  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Added these functions to allow users of the
	  stats code to
	  use default values for the various stats functions. This
	  is useful if an error is raised when

2008-07-17 17:44  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Removed the HORRIBLE hack whereby one could
	  pass parameters to the stats
	  code in order to get it not to throw an exception.
	  
	  I ought to have my coding licence revoked. But at least until
	  then, I
	  can try to restore my karma by restoring the code to a better
	  state.
	  
	  So anyway, if you call one of the stats functions on a
	  non-existant or
	  illegal file, it's your responsibility to deal with the
	  exceptions
	  that might pop out.

2008-07-17 17:43  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Simplified the stats handling code related to
	  suggestion files.
	  
	  If a user modifies a suggestion file without using our tools,
	  she simply has to ask the toolkit to recompute the stats (and
	  this will only affect the has-suggestion test). If she doesn't
	  the toolkit will have out-of-date suggestion stats, but that's
	  okay.

2008-07-17 17:43  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Instead of storing a Python tuple in the
	  database, simply store
	  the data into two separate columns.

2008-07-17 17:12  dwaynebailey

	* tools/podebug.py: Add Mock Swedish rewrite style

2008-07-17 16:57  dwaynebailey

	* storage/factory.py, storage/mo.py, storage/pocommon.py,
	  storage/tbx.py, storage/tmx.py, storage/wordfast.py,
	  storage/xliff.py: Implent a function to return all known
	  multilingual formats, their extensions and mimetypes
	  Add names to formats (to be localised sometime in the future)
	  Add missing extensions and mimetypes
	  Remove knowledge for formats from virtaal

2008-07-17 14:53  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py: Keep a reference in unit._store to the
	  containing translation store. Provide accessors in the unit class
	  that enables us to access the source and target language of the
	  containing document.

2008-07-17 14:21  friedelwolff

	* storage/cpo.py: Provide access to the libgettextpo version and
	  use this to enable workarounds
	  for bugs related to notes in certain libgettextpo versions.

	  duplicating some of it here

2008-07-17 12:58  friedelwolff

	  to None. They are mostly not yet used anyway.

2008-07-17 08:09  friedelwolff

	* convert/oo2po.py, convert/oo2xliff.py: Set the source and target
	  language of the output files

2008-07-17 07:55  friedelwolff

	* tools/pogrep.py: Set the source and target language of the

2008-07-17 07:51  friedelwolff

	* filters/pofilter.py: Set the source and target language of the
	  filtered file for the sake of formats where this matters.

2008-07-17 07:44  friedelwolff

2008-07-17 07:40  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: +Helper fucntion to get the xml:lang attribute

2008-07-17 07:38  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_mo.py: Rewrite file access for proper functioning

2008-07-04 02:00  sumpfralle

	* storage/versioncontrol/__init__.py,

	  storage/versioncontrol/darcs.py, storage/versioncontrol/git.py,
	  storage/versioncontrol/hg.py, storage/versioncontrol/svn.py: add
	  "is_available" function to all version control modules

	  This change should also speed up version control handling in
	  general, since

2008-07-04 01:04  sumpfralle

	* storage/versioncontrol/__init__.py: small improvements of the
	  version control systems handling:
	  - fix improper except statement (exceptions tuple instead of a

	  - avoid lists as default parameter values
	  - add function for collecting the list of available version

	* storage/versioncontrol/git.py: fix git support for v1.5.3 (or
	  higher) by setting "--work-tree"
	  this patch was contributed by Miklos Vajna

2008-07-01 20:08  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Improved the mod_info storage scheme to store
	  a tuple of the mtime and size of a file
	  instead of the truly ugly integer scheme that I cooked up in what
	  could only have been
	  the result of too many hours of coding (and hence the concomitant
	  loss of reason).

2008-07-01 20:06  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: _getfileid of a directory will raise an
	  AssertionError. We
	  deal with this by adding AssertionError to the list of
	  exceptions caught in _getfileid.

2008-06-24 13:11  winterstream

	* storage/test_mo.py: Added a test to ensure that the output of
	  msgfmt and pocompile are identical for
	  files of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 units.

2008-06-23 12:49  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Modified get_mod_info to raise an exception
	  when it is passed a directory.

2008-06-23 12:47  winterstream

	* storage/base.py, storage/pypo.py, storage/statsdb.py: Added some
	  robustness to the stasistics code to handle corrupt files.
	  The boolean parameter errors_return_empty can be passed to a
	  number
	  of the methods in Statdb; if errors_return_empty is true, then
	  they
	  will not raise exceptions, but instead return empty or zero
	  values.
	  
	  Created a ParseError exception which should be raised by parsers
	  which
	  run into parsing problems. So far, only pypo.py does this (and in
	  a
	  somewhat rudimentary way).

	* filters/checks.py: [Contributed by Nicolas François] Test all
	  plural forms of a plural unit, even if some errors occurred in
	  the first form. Combine all messages into one FilterFailure which
	  is propagated up. This completely fixes bug 345.

2008-06-20 13:01  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: [Contributed by Nicolas François] Test all

2008-06-20 12:14  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Convert each plural form to unicode before
	  passing to individual tests. This fixes the worst part of bug
	  122. More to come.

2008-06-20 11:30  walter_l

	* storage/poheader.py, storage/test_poheader.py: Moved
	  translate.storage.poheader.poheader.tzstring() out of its parent
	  class to
	  translate.storage.poheader.tzstring() (directly to the poheader
	  sub-module).
	  The function does not use the class or an instance, anyway.

2008-06-20 09:21  walter_l

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Replaced usage of
	  exception.message with exception.args[0], which is equivalent
	  within this commit's context.
	  
	  This fixes bug 424.

2008-06-19 23:28  sumpfralle

	* search/indexer/test_indexers.py: indexer: adapted tests for new
	  directory layout

2008-06-19 20:52  sumpfralle

	* search/indexer/CommonIndexer.py,
	  search/indexer/PyLuceneIndexer.py,
	  search/indexer/XapianIndexer.py, search/indexer/__init__.py: use
	  different sub-directories for databases of different indexing
	  engines
	  rename the indexing directory from ".poindex-PROJECT-LANGUAGE" to
	  ".translation_index"
	  note for UPGRADING: you have to remove old indexing directories
	  manually
	  
	  these changes are meant to ease migrations from one indexing
	  engine to another and to
	  allow different indexing engines to be on the same server

2008-06-18 14:12  winterstream

	* filters/checks.py: Moved the results_cache clearing code to the
	  appropriate method. It should
	  afterall be in the run_filters method of the base class.

2008-06-14 09:20  friedelwolff

	* search/indexer/__init__.py: Merge new indexing work from

	  None (possible with some translation formats)

2008-06-12 10:46  friedelwolff

	* storage/tmx.py: Implement .copy() for the TMX translation unit.
	  This fixes bug 414.

2008-06-12 09:34  friedelwolff

	* storage/pypo.py: While we don't have an encoding for processing a
	  header, let's decode it as ASCII while ignoring errors. We redo
	  it later properly, so this is just to get the initial encoding.

2008-06-12 09:32  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_poheader.py: Remove failing test for Cordoba,
	  Argentina - probably a dailight savings issue, or something.
	  Probably not so interesting while the others all pass.

2008-06-11 13:29  friedelwolff

	* README: Explain Windows installation better

2008-06-11 10:28  friedelwolff

	* misc/_csv.c, misc/csv.py, storage/csvl10n.py: Remove old CSV
	  modules that are part of Python since version 2.3 (the minimum we
	  support). Adapt improts.

2008-06-10 08:46  friedelwolff

	* lang/common.py: Trim some docstrings to sane widths

2008-06-09 16:44  winterstream

	* filters/checks.py: A number of methods in UnitChecker were called
	  very, very frequently
	  and this contributed a lot to the running time of checks.
	  
	  Now, the results of a number of these methods are memoized (by
	  the
	  decorator cache_results). The cached results are cleared every
	  time
	  that TranslationChecker.run_test is called.
	  
	  On a small OpenOffice project, this has sliced the computation
	  time
	  of stats quite a lot and it should never result in a slow-down.
	  
	  Note that the decorator is deliberately specialized to accept
	  only
	  single argument methods. This is to avoid the runtime cost of
	  unpacking
	  arbitrary numbers of parameters.

2008-06-09 12:35  winterstream

	* filters/decoration.py, filters/test_checks.py: An underscore is a
	  valid variable name character. filtermarkedvariables did not
	  allow
	  for this. The current code would work for variable names with
	  underscores, if these
	  variables were the last tokens in the string; the unit tests
	  happened only to have
	  tested this case, which made them pass.
	  
	  The fix is simple: simply add a check for the underscore
	  character.
	  
	  Also added unit tests to cover this bug.

2008-06-09 12:25  winterstream

	* storage/pypo.py: Read the first unit from a po file without
	  decoding the characters;
	  that is, everything is read into a Python str type. Then check to
	  see if there is a header; if there is, then try to determine the
	  file encoding from that and set the file encoding. Otherwise,
	  leave
	  the file encoding at the default (UTF-8).
	  
	  Then, decode the file contents and restart the parsing.
	  
	  Originally, the parser would assume a UTF-8 encoding until it hit
	  a Content-Type declaration which specified the file encoding.
	  Only
	  then would it change the decoding scheme.
	  
	  This worked fine for non-UTF-8 files which contained only ASCII
	  characters in the header (which appeared before the Content-Type
	  declaration), but raised an exception if any non-ASCII characters
	  appeared there, since a UTF decoding error occured.
	  
	  This patch both simplifies the original code and fixed this bug.

2008-06-09 12:21  winterstream

	* storage/pypo.py: Po parsing now works directly with an array of
	  lines. The previous
	  version split the entire file contents into an array of lines,
	  only
	  to join subarrays into strings, which it would pass to the unit
	  parser,
	  which in its turn would split the strings into arrays of lines.
	  This
	  inefficiency was remedied by simply factoring out the line array
	  handling code of the unit parsing code and calling that directly
	  on the main array of lines (from the file parsing method).

2008-06-06 14:25  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Make all error
	  messages Unicode.
	  Adapt test and remove function that convert Unicode error
	  messages

2008-06-06 09:24  winterstream

	* storage/test_statsdb.py: Added some tests for StatsDB.

2008-06-06 09:23  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: StatsDb._getstoredfileid could return None.
	  This was a problem in methods which
	  used _getstoredfileid, since some expected the return value not
	  to be None.
	  
	  It turns out that there is no use for a None return value. So if
	  there is no
	  stored fileid, then we simply generate it with cachestore. Since
	  we're not just
	  returning stored fileids, _getstoredfileid was renamed to
	  _getfileid. Naturally,
	  those methods that handled the case where None was returned could
	  have that code
	  removed.

2008-06-06 09:23  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Originally, statsdb compared the mtime of a
	  file to the mtime it had stored in the DB to see whether the file
	  changed.
	  
	  On some file systems, mtime only has one second resolution, which
	  means
	  that if a file changes quickly enough after the statsdb has
	  stored its
	  mtime, the statsdb won't realize that the file has changed, and
	  it will
	  therefore supply incorrect stats about the file.
	  
	  In order for this to be ameliorated, we now also take the file
	  size into
	  account and we store a value which contains mtime bits as well as
	  file
	  size bits into the database. The only files which can now slip
	  past the
	  system are files which are modified soon enough and which retain
	  their
	  sizes. And honestly, such files, if they are valid translation
	  files,
	  are so unlikely to contain significant changes which maintain the
	  file
	  size that they can be ignored.

2008-06-05 08:18  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Add ability to validate that is we fail
	  or fail_serious that the error message is correct.
	  If the message is not correct we will still fail, also added
	  tests to exercise this new path in both type.

2008-06-04 18:56  dwaynebailey

	* filters/helpers.py: Remove isalnum_u - unused

2008-05-26 10:52  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Small cleanups and comments. A small improvement
	  for the case where we already have MAX_CANDIDATES candidates
	  (likely in some cases with pot2po where MAX_CANDIDATES==1, for
	  example).

2008-05-26 10:42  friedelwolff

	* search/match.py: Replace the code that searches for the starting
	  position of the search range with a binary search. Thisgives a
	  noticable performance increase for a large TM.

2008-05-26 09:54  winterstream

	* storage/statsdb.py: Pootle requires a way to determine
	  precomputed property values PER UNIT
	  (as opposed to StatsCache.filestats which supplies only sets of
	  unit
	  indices which correspond to given properties). This is necessary
	  for
	  example, if one wants to compute the source word count of a unit.
	  
	  For this reason, StatsCache.unitstats was added to supply arrays
	  which
	  map unit indices to property values. This may therefore return
	  dictionaries
	  such as
	  { 'sourcewordcount': [4, 1, 10, 20],
	  'targetwordcount': [0, 0, 0, 0] }
	  indicating that the source word count of unit 0 is 4, unit 1 is
	  1, etc.
	  and that the target word counts for all units are 0.

2008-05-26 07:54  friedelwolff

	* search/lshtein.py: Remove assert - gives small performance

	  Adapted filteraccelerators to take an option paramater containing
	  valid accelerators
	  Changed multifilter to allow it to take other arguments that it
	  would pass to the filter function
	  Bug 395 has been raised to audit the use of filteraccelerators
	  and perhaps change its behaviour to simply remove all
	  accelerators not just valid accelerators.

	* filters/checks.py, filters/decoration.py, filters/prefilters.py,
	  filters/test_checks.py, filters/test_decoration.py,
	  lang/common.py, lang/fi.py: Fixes bug 289
	  Adds the concept of an validaccel list and checks found

	  activity

2007-12-15 12:23  friedelwolff

	* storage/statsdb.py: Use os.path.realpath() instead of
	  os.path.abspath() - this resolves names taking links and
	  non-canonical names into account (// in the name, for example).
	  This could avoid some duplicates.

	  storage/test_po.py, storage/test_pypo.py: Merge
	  branch/toolkit-C-po changes r6459:6622 into trunk.
	  
	  These are only the PO related files. All users of the PO classes
	  still need to be migrated. The tools still use the Python PO
	  implementation but by using the environment variables USECPO=1
	  you can force the tools to use the C PO version (USECPO=0 forces
	  the use of Python PO). Using USECPO will report the
	  implementation
	  being used, without USECPO operation continue as normal.
	  
	  Common tests are in test_po while implementation specific test or
	  tests that differ slightly are in test_pypo and test_cpo.
	  
	  The next steps will be to merge changes made to the tools the use
	  po.py into trunk. This will be done slowly to ensure that tests
	  and operation continue as normal. On the branch almost all tests
	  are functioning correctly. This will not be so on trunk until all
	  tests have been ported.

2007-07-29 11:34  dwaynebailey

	* convert/prop2po.py, convert/test_prop2po.py, storage/po.py:
	  Properly ignore DONT_TRANSLATE i.e. using a return value of
	  'discard' but should fix storage class to not return empty units,
	  fix test.
	  Make all source comments into 'developer' comments: #. in PO,
	  ensure that we keep the same comment order by adding a 'position'
	  option to adding comments in PO. This is hackish and needs to be
	  fixed in the storage class.
	  Comments from target .properties files should be added as
	  translator comments, but doesn't work yet, needs some thought and
	  logic to discard comments that are actually developer comments in
	  translator comment style.

2007-07-18 09:31  friedelwolff

	* convert/oo2po.py, convert/oo2xliff.py, convert/po2oo.py,
	  convert/xliff2oo.py, storage/po.py: Alignment of oo2{xlf,po}:
	  These are two tools, they should be one and they share a lot of
	  code.
	  This first commit aligns comments: XLIFF/PO -> target/source
	  format, and
	  aligns variable names between each instance: poelement -> unit
	  and
	  xliffunit -> unit etc.
	  Removed unquotefrompo (this needs further testing but should be
	  OK)
	  Each convertor po2oo and xliff2oo can actually do both formats as
	  we've used
	  the factory class.
	  We now only add units that actually exits otherwise we return
	  none from
	  maktargetunit(): This solves the blank unit problem in oo2xliff
	  and
	  removes, removeblanks() and isnotblank() from the po class.
	  We now use 'xlf' not 'xliff' for the format extension.

	* storage/test_csvl10n.py, storage/test_dtd.py,
	  storage/test_monolingual.py, storage/test_properties.py,
	  storage/test_tbx.py, storage/test_tmx.py, storage/test_txt.py:
	  Remove the tests test_markreview() and test_errors() that were
	  expecting exceptions before

2007-06-25 13:47  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_base.py, storage/test_po.py, storage/test_xliff.py:
	  Remove test_markreview() and test_errors() from test_base and
	  move to test_po and test_xliff. Replace unnecessary calls to
	  settarget() with normal member assignments.

2007-06-25 13:46  dwaynebailey

	* storage/mo.py, storage/test_mo.py, tools/pocompile.py: Add
	  Gettext .mo (Machine Object), the compiled PO format as a base
	  class
	  derived format. Move code from pocompile into the .mo class and
	  adjust
	  pocompile to use the storage class.
	  The test_mo is basic and needs tests added for the various things
	  found in
	  an MO file.

2007-06-25 13:44  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py: Give sane default implementations to adderror(),
	  geterrors(), markreviewneeded()

2007-06-22 15:05  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pocompile.py: Less references to PO since we can also
	  compile from XLIFF

2007-06-22 14:58  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pocompile.py: Make sure that the --fuzzy option works
	  again. Again a PO specific hack that
	  isn't elegant.

2007-06-22 14:28  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pocompile.py: Add handling of msgctxt and KDE style
	  comments in the compilation.
	  We can now compile all types of PO files into MO files. This is
	  hackish
	  and the format specific stuff should go elsewhere but its a good
	  start.

2007-06-22 14:07  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pocompile.py: Make pocompile able to compile plural
	  messages
	  Also ensure that it can compile PoXliff and normal XLIFF files

	  use translated entries and that the headers or source strings can
	  be UTF-8.
	  Add an mounpack helper funtion to convert an MO file into hex

2007-06-21 08:25  dwaynebailey

	* convert/odf2po, convert/odf2po.py, convert/test_odf2po.py,
	  storage/odf.py, storage/test_odf.py: Pull the ODF parser from the
	  convertor and add it as a base class derived format.
	  It is not fully base class compliant. There is a base class test
	  but as yet it
	  doesn't mean much.
	  Major renaming across the files to change element -> unit, sxw ->
	  odf and refer to
	  the generic odf as apposed to Writer/sxw/etc.
	  The extraction to PO still works but there is off course still no
	  po2odf available
	  but hopefully as we clean up the class we'll get there. Till then
	  its not much use
	  except for testing.
	  The main problem now with our created PO file is that we are
	  stripping all XML tags,
	  which in most cases is OK but we lose in paragraph markings,
	  style changes, etc.
	  We shouldn't do that.
	  What does seem to be emerging though is that this could become a
	  generic
	  xml2{xliff,po} convertor as there seem to be some standard
	  recipes for what needs to be
	  translated. We'll see.

2007-06-21 08:02  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pomerge.py: Change xliff file extension to .xlf

2007-04-04 14:12  friedelwolff

	* storage/statistics.py: Use a dictionary .classification to store

	  checks and don't call classifyunits in the constructor.

2007-04-04 14:03  friedelwolff

	* convert/po2xliff.py: Always call markfuzzy() for newly created
	  XLIFF units to ensure that the approved attribute is always set

2007-04-04 13:46  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_xliff.py: Update testing to reflect new fuzzy
	  behaviour. If the approved attribute is not specified, it is 'no'
	  and the unit is considered fuzzy

2007-04-04 13:43  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Update the behaviour of isfuzzy() and
	  markfuzzy().
	  
	  According to version 1.2 of the PO representation guide, only the
	  approved
	  attribute should be considered fuzzyness for backconversion to
	  PO. This is
	  the approach we now take in xliff. We still set the state and
	  state-qualifier
	  if there is a target, but this way we don't need a target.

2007-04-04 13:42  andreaspauley

	* __version__.py: Bumped version number for the release of beta 2.

2007-04-04 12:59  friedelwolff

2007-04-03 13:50  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py: Try to support the general notion of
	  translator and developer comments and notes. Mostly carried over

	  is text

2007-03-30 12:00  andreaspauley

	  set. This fixes a bug in Pootle where jToolkit cannot send xliff
	  files in plaintext to the browser because the filename has been
	  lost.

2007-03-30 10:47  friedelwolff

	* storage/poxliff.py: Fix parsing of plural units. This fixes the

2006-12-07 07:34  andreaspauley

	* storage/factory.py: Made the return value for guesstype() a bit
	  more descriptive.

2006-12-06 14:59  andreaspauley

	* storage/factory.py: The previous storage factory commit broke
	  quite a few of our tests in convert, this fixes it.

2006-12-06 12:39  andreaspauley

2006-12-05 09:26  andreaspauley

	* filters/pofilter.py, filters/test_pofilter.py: Updated pofilter
	  and the tests to use adderror() and geterrors() from the storage
	  api, rather than add po-specific translator comments.

2006-12-05 09:23  andreaspauley

	* storage/base.py, storage/po.py, storage/test_base.py,
	  storage/test_csvl10n.py, storage/test_monolingual.py,
	  storage/test_properties.py, storage/test_tbx.py,
	  storage/test_tmx.py, storage/xliff.py: Added 2 new methods to the

	* storage/base.py: Replaced tabs with spaces.

2006-12-01 09:55  andreaspauley

2006-11-28 09:54  andreaspauley

	* storage/base.py, storage/po.py, storage/test_base.py,
	  storage/test_csvl10n.py, storage/test_dtd.py,
	  storage/test_monolingual.py, storage/test_tbx.py,
	  storage/test_tmx.py, storage/xliff.py: Added a markreviewneeded()
	  method to the base API, implemented it in xliff.py and po.py

	  usage and naming conventions from pogrep.

2006-11-22 23:08  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2txt.py, convert/test_po2txt.py: Correctly handle the
	  non template version of po2txt. Without a template we simply use
	  the source text. We now are able to use the source properly is
	  the message is untranslated or fuzzy.

2006-11-22 22:39  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2txt.py, convert/test_po2txt.py: When merging .txt
	  translations into a template we will no longer use blank
	  messages. We can optionally use fuzzy messages with teh --fuzzy
	  and --nofuzzy options.

2006-11-22 19:39  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Add references to bug 178 and also add

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Check that once
	  variables and spaces are removed, that if we are left with only
	  punctuation that we don't consider this a candidate for the
	  'unchanged' test.

2006-11-22 18:56  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Ignore accronyms in
	  teh 'unchanged' test

2006-11-22 11:53  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Added a wishlist test to check that we
	  can extract items within nested tags ie <div><p>This</p>And
	  this</div>
	  Currently we only extract the first item.

2006-11-22 11:47  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Add test for <div> tag

2006-11-22 07:14  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2moz.py, convert/po2prop.py, convert/prop2mozfunny.py,
	  convert/test_po2prop.py: po2prop now has the ability to output
	  files according to the Java spec (escaped Unicode) or Mozilla
	  (Unicode chars).
	  The --personality option gives this ability with the default
	  being "java". Added a test to test for the two styles.
	  Added a wrapper function to do the Mozilla style easily and
	  adjusted po2moz and prop2mozfunny to use this function.

2006-11-22 06:50  dwaynebailey

	* misc/optrecurse.py: Ignore Subversion .svn directories

	* storage/po.py: Rewrite the plural handling logic in settarget to
	  distinguish clearly between a single plural form language and a
	  single (simple) string passed in a list

2006-11-20 10:03  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Remove debug statements commited by accident

2006-11-17 08:22  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Change 'fails' to only
	  work for normal failures. Rename seriousfails to 'fails_serious'
	  to make it clearer that it realtes to 'fails'. Change all tests
	  that create SeriousFilterFailures so that they use fails_serious.

2006-11-16 15:08  friedelwolff

	* filters/decoration.py, filters/test_checks.py: Don't report an
	  empty string as purepunc. +test

2006-11-16 14:50  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py, filters/decoration.py, filters/test_checks.py:

	  vs.
	  funcA(), funcB() en funcC() something.

2006-11-16 14:20  friedelwolff

	  allows a simple valid case.

2006-11-16 14:16  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Allow certain simpleplurals in target
	  language. This paves the way for more flexible simpleplurals
	  test.

2006-11-16 12:42  friedelwolff

	* filters/test_checks.py: Test that a failure for accelerators in
	  Mozilla is a serious failure

2006-11-16 12:39  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Add the ability to mark tests as critical, and
	  use it mark variables test critical for Mozilla

2006-11-16 10:48  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Another Mozilla variables style - already
	  trapped by '$(', ')' style checks but here for tracking

2006-11-16 10:42  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Make double sure we can also detect $_VAR
	  type variables that seem to appear in Mozilla

2006-11-16 09:50  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: Redo the logic of .isblank() to return False if
	  there are msgidcomments. Remove weird logic.

2006-11-16 08:11  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Add test to make sure that we can trap a
	  kde comment even of the msgid is actually a blank msgid
	  
	  eg:
	  
	  msgid "_: comment\n"
	  msgstr "_: comment\n"

2006-11-16 06:53  jens_herden

	* storage/base.py: fix indentation error

2006-11-16 02:39  varsist

	* storage/xliff.py: Variable name change from 'suggestion' based
	  variables names to alttrans based

2006-11-15 06:51  varsist

	* storage/test_xliff.py, storage/xliff.py: Added methods to support
	  the xliff alt-trans (suggestions) tag. Added test cases for xliff
	  alt-trans/suggestions work

2006-11-14 15:27  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: When merging, take on the fuzzy status of the
	  other unit

2006-11-13 15:05  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Remove debugging statements that were commited
	  by accident

2006-11-13 12:13  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_po.py: Test more PO comments functionality

2006-11-08 09:41  friedelwolff

	  the poheader class to enable reuse from the poxliff class.

2006-11-06 13:35  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: Only parse the XML string if it contains
	  something (return empty store object otherwise)

2006-11-03 16:12  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py: tags2 should not have kdecomments removed
	  Also changed tags to tags1 or tags2 as appropriate as reusing the
	  vartiable will just create confusion.

2006-11-03 11:48  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: If the first string contains no xml tags,
	  check that the second also contains none. Fix for currently
	  failing test.

2006-11-02 11:01  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: Use the dictionary with corrected keys [reported
	  and patch by Hok Kakada]

2006-11-02 10:26  friedelwolff

	* storage/lisa.py: Pass constructor parameter correctly

	* tools/pocount.py: Remove references to msgid and msgstr and
	  replave with source and target. This in preperation for making
	  pocount less PO centric.

2006-10-31 19:28  dwaynebailey

	* convert/csv2po.py, convert/dtd2po.py, convert/html2po.py,
	  convert/oo2po.py, convert/prop2po.py: Use msgctxt as our default
	  disambiguator in the various convertors.

2006-10-31 07:51  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py: Add .isblank() for PO compatibility - might be
	  temporary

2006-10-31 07:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py: Add .gettargetlen() to access the length of the
	  target string and possible plural forms

2006-10-30 14:50  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Fix typo (unbalanced parentheses)

2006-10-30 14:20  friedelwolff

	* storage/xliff.py: Implement initial .isreview() for xliff units

2006-10-30 14:19  friedelwolff

	  marked comment (.isreview() already does that)

2006-10-30 13:11  friedelwolff

	* storage/base.py, storage/lisa.py: Use and pass unitclass
	  parameters

2006-10-29 12:10  dwaynebailey

	* search/match.py: Disable verbose debugging output

2006-10-28 14:26  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Iits a tabs test not an escapes test

2006-10-27 07:38  friedelwolff

	* tools/pocount.py: Fix wrong logic of .fuzzymessages() that caused
	  pocount to always give 0 fuzzy messages

2006-10-26 14:01  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Seperate newlines test
	  (\r and \n) and tabs test (\t) from the escapes test

2006-10-26 11:29  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Turn some tests into wishlist wtest_ items

2006-10-26 11:26  dwaynebailey

	* storage/lisa.py, storage/test_xliff.py, storage/xliff.py: Add
	  ability to set the target language.

2006-10-26 07:15  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_po2oo.py: Test conversion with escpaes of \t, \r and
	  \n

2006-10-25 16:17  friedelwolff

	* storage/oo.py: Escape \r and \t correctly with output

2006-10-25 15:29  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Change some items to wishlist by
	  changing to wtest_

2006-10-25 15:20  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_po2oo.py: Fix test to cater for change from
	  'exclude' to 'exclude-all'

2006-10-25 15:13  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_prop2po.py: Disable some wishlist tests by using
	  wtest_

2006-10-25 06:13  dwaynebailey

	* convert/convert.py, convert/pot2po.py, convert/test_pot2po.py,
	  storage/po.py, storage/test_po.py: Add a concept of an
	  authoritative merge to po::merge. If the po file is authoritative
	  then
	  we abandon all sourcecomments and automaticcomments from the file
	  being merged into the authoritative
	  one. By default we continue with the old behaviour.
	  
	  Added 'msgctxt' as a duplicate style which will use Gettext
	  0.15.x's ability to use context
	  information to disambiguate duplicates. This will become the
	  default mode in the future, but
	  requires further testing.

2006-10-24 16:04  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: Remove incorrect extra unescaping

2006-10-24 06:38  dwaynebailey

	* filters/decoration.py: Only pull variables from a (startmaker,
	  None) style variable if the length of the variable is > 1. Use
	  (startmarker, 0) if you need zero length variables.
	  This change makes all the variable tests pass.

2006-10-24 05:44  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py, storage/test_po.py: Add ability to handle msgctxt
	  Add test for copying a msg and for making msgctxt obsolete.

2006-10-23 18:05  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py, filters/test_checks.py: Handle the case where
	  we have xmltag false positives. E.g. "<Error>" which looks
	  like XML/HTML but should actually be translated.
	  These are handles by 1) identifying them as being the same length
	  as the source text,
	  2) not containing any '=' sign. Thus the following would not be
	  detected by this hack.
	  "An <Error> occured"
	  "<Error name="bob">"
	  But these ones need human eyes anyway.

2006-10-23 17:26  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2oo.py: Make the defalt filter action = none ie do
	  nothing and don't warn. Until we have a way of clearly marking
	  false positives we'll have to diable this funtionality. Also
	  renamed exclude to exclude-all so that it is clearer what it does
	  ie it excludes 'all' vs excludes 'serious'.

2006-10-20 08:35  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py, storage/test_po.py: Handle reflow of \n related
	  sentences (with test). Not the cleanest hack, this section has
	  gotten quite messy.

	* misc/textwrap.py: Update to the lastest Python Subversion (fixes
	  some performance issues)
	  Reimplement the drop_whitespace feature

2006-10-20 06:49  dwaynebailey

	* misc/textwrap.py, storage/po.py, storage/test_po.py: Use our
	  custom textwrap and add feature to allow the preservation of
	  whitespace text chunks (default version clean up leading and
	  trailing whitespace)
	  Add test for wrapping long lines
	  Add ability to wrap lines when we have no \n style lines. Still
	  need to deal with message that have been broken into \n seperated
	  lists.

2006-10-20 06:05  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py, storage/test_po.py: Add tests to check for \n
	  newline wrapping (already works correctly)
	  Added test and fix to place firstline > 71 chars on a wrap line
	  ie start with msgid "" (fix and test work)

2006-10-16 07:01  varsist

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: Make sure we are handling comments
	  correctly when we obsolete

2006-10-07 14:29  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Fix kdecomment_merge test
	  Disable accelerator_keys_not_in_sentence test and make it a
	  wtest_ ie a wish

2006-09-01 06:48  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Test for escape checing were wrong. Added
	  a real life example that was not being detected. Seems most of
	  the problem was using raw strings in the tests. Most of that has

2006-08-22 10:17  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: Check that we can
	  reuse translations even if the msgidcomment changes. Tests that

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Reformat expected
	  result in

	* convert/pot2po.py: Carry over the header
	  comments from the template PO file into the output PO file
	  otherwise
	  if there are no comments use the ones from the input POT file.

2006-07-25 19:05  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py,

	  Remove unused variables.

2006-07-25 11:04  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Removed multiline test.
	  This goes against the general idea that HTML places
	  no significance in line breaks. It is probably also
	  going to add complexity that offers little return in value.

2006-07-25 10:56  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Add two tests. The
	  first to try to pick up mismatched encodings (test doesn't seem
	  to do exactly what I wanted). The second to highlight the
	  problem when you are
	  processing files using a template approach and the template is
	  missing. We are currently
	  adding the translation as the source string. We should be
	  abandonign the translation.

2006-07-25 06:12  friedelwolff

	  txt2po file.txt > file.po
	  
	  Also made some other progress verbage output to stderr.

2006-07-17 18:08  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py,
	  filters/test_checks.py: Implement printf
	  checking based on a patch by contributed by
	  Matt Chisholm - matt at bittorrent dot com.
	  Improved the regex to understand more fully all the options but
	  left the final
	  printf "type" as \w so that we can capture any character, not
	  only those we know about.
	  Added test to pick up most issues and moved a Mozilla variable
	  test that was really
	  a printf test to test_printf().
	  The regex is based on the syntax outlined at
	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf
	  Ideally the printf test should be rolled into the variable test.
	  But this is good for
	  now.
	  Also in future it would be good to allow projects to define
	  whether they in fact have print
	  style variables and also to make use of the #, c-syntax type
	  comments in PO files.

	  stdout

2006-07-10 18:10  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Add test for the case
	  where translation does not contain the character
	  used as accelerator. Convert to "XXXXX (&A)" for now. Still
	  needs
	  some thought on the reverse ie PO -> DTD

2006-07-10 18:01  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Add test to check that
	  we can manage folding accelerators for foreign languages.

	  checks
	  1) To check that we manage accesskeys that we cannot merge

	  (broken)

2006-06-05 16:29  friedelwolff

	  class

2006-06-05 16:28  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_monolingual.py: First version to serve as superclass
	  for test_properties.py

2006-06-05 16:24  friedelwolff

	* convert/prop2mozfunny.py, storage/test_properties.py: base API
	  naming conventions

2006-06-05 16:23  friedelwolff

	* storage/properties.py: Implement parsestring(), warn on use of
	  deprecated API, don't create empty units unnecessarily

2006-06-05 16:05  friedelwolff

	* convert/prop2po.py: .propelements -> .units

2006-06-05 14:46  friedelwolff

	* convert/prop2po.py: Use locationindex from base class

2006-06-05 14:45  friedelwolff

	* storage/properties.py: Use base class makeindex()

2006-06-05 13:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/properties.py: indentation fix

2006-06-05 13:44  friedelwolff

	* storage/properties.py: Move to base class. Retain backwards
	  compatibility (tests pass unchanged)

2006-06-02 17:51  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: rewrite parseheader() to rather use base class API

2006-06-02 17:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_po.py: test a bit of poheader functionality

2006-06-01 21:09  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_prop2po.py: Enable tests for Bugs #115 and #116

2006-06-01 20:57  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, prefilters.py, test_checks.py: [Forwardport]
	  Allow variables to be deleted.  This is probably a suboptimal
	  approach but works - This fixes some simplecaps tests that are
	  now enabled We now ignore 'unchanged' items of len == 1 if the
	  word is in a notranslate list - Enabled test for this Remove a
	  bad stratcaps test

2006-06-01 19:16  davidfraser

	* storage/test_dtd.py: added test for roundtrip of quoting /
	  escaping problems

2006-06-01 16:41  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Correct test

2006-06-01 16:27  dwaynebailey

	* convert/html2po.py: Make sure that we split lines on <br> for a
	  better PO editing experience.

2006-06-01 14:53  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: Can now handle the allcaps
	  case of simplecaps errors

2006-06-01 14:51  davidfraser

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: replace escaping/unescaping with
	  system that is actual symmetrical this utilises the new ability
	  of extractwithoutquotes to actually get the escaping via another
	  function fixed tests for msgid comments - they now expect a real
	  newline rather than \\n

2006-06-01 14:40  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: REmove KDE comments before
	  checking for capitals Changed failing simplecaps tests to use the
	  OOo checker as their failing most probably relates to the fact
	  that we do not remove variables when checking for capitals
	  (Removing vars is still TODO).

2006-06-01 14:36  davidfraser

	* misc/: quote.py, test_quote.py: change includeescapes to return
	  the actual escaped/unescaped value rather than simply whether to
	  escape it or not   (this probably requires an argument name
	  change, and better explanation - see change to
	  isnewlineortabescape in test)   the old method of returning a
	  boolean is still supported, but deprecated and needs removing
	  once fixed elsewhere	 this gives more flexibility in handling
	  escaping warn when invalid named unicode escapes are encountered,
	  rather than raising an error

2006-06-01 14:11  davidfraser

	* storage/test_po.py: added test that quoteforpo and unquotefrompo
	  round string strings properly (strings same as in test_base.py)

2006-06-01 13:54  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_base.py: Test string roundtripping

2006-06-01 13:06  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: decoration.py, test_decoration.py: Allow fullstops
	  inside a variables eg $pluginWizard.label;

2006-06-01 12:23  dwaynebailey

	* filters/prefilters.py: Make the regular expression consider
	  Unicode, so that \w identifies non-ascii letter characters.

2006-06-01 10:59  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py: Make sure we don't merge KDE comments if we find
	  them in the translation.

2006-06-01 10:46  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Add test to ensure that we merge KDE
	  disambiguations correctly.

2006-06-01 10:45  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pocount.py: Add UTF-8 header marker

2006-05-31 13:56  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_oo2po.py: Test of a \\r entry in helpcontent2 which
	  gets messed in PO as it appears as \\\r it makes the roundtrip
	  but its not actually what is required.  We really need \\\\r.

2006-05-31 13:46  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_oo.py: Test that we roundtrip \\r quotes properly.

2006-05-30 17:59  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: clarify parsestring usage (not a normal method)
	  don't overwrite filename if input doesn't really tell us a
	  filename

2006-05-30 15:39  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: use template for quoteforpo for plural targets too

2006-05-30 15:37  davidfraser

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: added test that checks the current
	  behaviour of setting target multistrings (the behaviour itself
	  needs checking, see the FIXME) make quoting with templates work
	  if self.msgstr is currently a plural dictionary but a singular
	  target is submitted

2006-05-24 11:44  friedelwolff

	* convert/: oo2po.py, test_oo2po.py: Handle \n, \t, and \r better.
	  Test differently for them.

2006-05-24 11:39  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: Handle \r just like \n and \t

2006-05-24 11:15  friedelwolff

	* storage/html.py: Add "content" as attribute to include (fix one
	  test)

2006-05-23 17:35  davidfraser

	* convert/: mozfunny2prop.py, prop2mozfunny.py:
	  mozillapropertiesencode now treats \n as part of the string, so
	  strip off any before passing and add back later

2006-05-23 17:22  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: avoid double-escaping quotes - they are
	  already escaped in escapeforpo

2006-05-23 17:20  davidfraser

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: added test for quoting problem that came
	  up in roundtrip

2006-05-23 17:09  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: remove empty lines at start or end of dtd

2006-05-23 17:06  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: ignore SYSTEM parameters (<!ENTITY % brandDTD
	  SYSTEM "chrome://...">)

2006-05-23 17:01  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: fix odd inconsistency in escaping characters add
	  TODO about changing encoding in msgid (just a check)

2006-05-23 16:51  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: handle inconsistency between mixed entities in
	  original and translation if an entity is mixed but not found in
	  the originals, delete it from mixed entities so it is just
	  treated ordinarily (these results in Nones being passed to
	  convertelement, which seems to make sense to return None from
	  rather than adding special cases before calling it)

2006-05-23 16:31  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: try to use underlying escapeforpo function
	  rather than escaping ourselves get rid of \r in dtd definitions
	  directly slight clean up of line stripping use .target property
	  which is simpler

2006-05-23 13:47  davidfraser

	* convert/test_prop2po.py: .source now represents \n as a newline
	  (although it is escaped in the underlying po file)

2006-05-23 13:45  davidfraser

	* misc/quote.py: make mozillapropertiesencode convert control
	  characters back to their escaped form this is safe now that the
	  whole line isn't passed through

2006-05-23 13:44  davidfraser

	* storage/properties.py: do stripping of end lines before handling
	  the line (this means we don't have to distinguish between real
	  endlines and escaped ones in the strings) only do
	  mozillapropertiesencode on the actual property values (this may
	  break keys that use it but I don't think I've seen that) only
	  strip spaces of properties so as not to strip of end lines

2006-05-23 13:42  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Some new tests to make sure we ignore
	  stuff that shouldn't be localised. Also some tests to make sure
	  we can reflow HTML properly and not end up with very odd
	  messgages.

2006-05-23 13:06  davidfraser

	* storage/dtd.py: try and ensure consistency in the number of blank
	  lines we output (successfully, it seems...)

2006-05-23 13:02  davidfraser

	* storage/test_dtd.py: try and be more consistent with other tests
	  (and pass!) by including a \n in the dtdsource for
	  test_comment_newline_space_closing

2006-05-23 12:56  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: cleaning up blank space

2006-05-23 12:53  davidfraser

	* storage/dtd.py: don't throw away comments and unparsed lines just
	  because no real entity followed them...  note that this adds a
	  number of new lines that we don't want, so fails tests, but the
	  failures aren't so bad and can be fixed

2006-05-23 12:46  davidfraser

	* misc/: quote.py, test_quote.py: tested extracting starting in a
	  string with a start/end quote the first character fixed lastpos
	  being initialized to 0 as this matches erroneously (None won't
	  match any position)

2006-05-17 00:58  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: When we merge from PO files with a literal
	  tab we end up converting tehm to \t which is incorrect.

2006-05-16 19:19  dwaynebailey

	* misc/quote.py: Recovering from SF CVS crash: Origianl 1.35
	  commit: The problem being corrected occurs when start and end
	  delimeters are not the same lenght eg in HTML <!-- (4) --> (3).
	  In this corner we have a line '[space]-->' and we are already in
	  the string.  So lastpos != pos = lenstart is 0 != 4 - 4 ie we get
	  confused.

	  I think this fix is correct in that it ignores the case when our
	  last delimeter was at pisition 0.  Because we only do this when
	  we are instring I don't think it will mess with other cases.

	  Original 1.36 commit: rather fix this by checking whether lastpos
	  really is a startdelim...

2006-05-16 14:55  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_po2csv.py: We should not be escaping \ escapes that
	  are already escaped.

2006-05-16 08:08  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_xliff2po.py: fix test: rename ids -> locations

2006-05-15 17:08  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: We should not get confused with variable
	  names that are also must translate words Unicode test for
	  musttranslate

2006-05-15 13:12  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pocount.py: Remove all the FIXME comments for things
	  that are now fixed.

2006-05-15 12:52  friedelwolff

	* tools/test_pocount.py: fix tab/spaces

2006-05-15 12:49  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: More tests: - Check that we don't include
	  ENTITY includes for translation - Check that we handle pretty
	  printed entities that have start and end blank newlines.

2006-05-15 08:28  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts.py: Comment out modifications to minidom classes

2006-05-15 08:27  friedelwolff

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Fix tabs/spaces

2006-05-07 08:58  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Test the strange condition of losing
	  comments and subsequent entities if the preceding closing comment
	  is ^[space]-->

2006-05-07 08:53  dwaynebailey

	* misc/test_quote.py: Multiline comments in a dtd like this:

	  <!--	 Comment  --> <!ENTITY some.label "Blah">

	  End up losing the comment and all the following entities.  The
	  culprit is the space before the end comment marker.  If you
	  remove that then it extracts correctly.

	  This test uncovers the problem.  We're calling it line by line
	  from the parser in dtd.py and thus we are already in the string
	  with we need to extract.

	  This one is breaking our otherwise very good language packs.

2006-05-06 22:37  dwaynebailey

	* convert/: moz2po.py, po2moz.py: Make sure we also process .html
	  files

	  MOZ_LANGPACK_CONTRIBUTORS works OK when converting back too...
	  (bug 118)

2006-05-05 16:02  davidfraser

	* convert/: mozfunny2prop.py, prop2mozfunny.py,
	  test_mozfunny2prop.py: handle commented out #defines in inc files
	  (just converting to properties, not back, so added TODO for fun)
	  deal with the special case of MOZ_LANGPACK_CONTRIBUTORS, and
	  auto-uncomment it - added test for this rename "prop" variables
	  to "inc" in test_mozfunny2prop.py

2006-05-05 15:52  davidfraser

	* convert/test_mozfunny2prop.py: added simple test for
	  mozfunny2prop

	* misc/quote.py: handle no escape (and make default argument) in
	  extract

2006-05-05 15:32  davidfraser

	* convert/html2po.py: need to quote line by line

2006-05-05 15:16  davidfraser

	* convert/prop2mozfunny.py: leave out blank lines at the end of inc
	  files

2006-05-05 15:12  davidfraser

	* convert/test_prop2mozfunny.py: added test_prop2mozfunny with test
	  for extra end of lines (bug 144)

2006-05-05 01:35  dwaynebailey

	* tools/: pocount.py, test_pocount.py: Test and fix to ensure that
	  we count old style KDE plurals correctly Fix counting of words in
	  KDE comments style source strings

2006-05-04 23:31  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, decoration.py, prefilters.py,
	  test_checks.py: Change accelerator test to report if an
	  accelerator is present but located before a bad accelerator
	  character eg a space Add an associated test for such a condition
	  Also add tests for newlines located within a string

2006-05-04 22:59  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Add further tests for multiline KDE
	  comments

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Add another short line add something at
	  the start case

	* filters/checks.py: Do not run doublewords test if the message is
	  unchanged.

2006-05-04 14:38  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: We shouldn't be merging KDE comments if
	  somehow the translator included them in their translations.

2006-05-04 10:43  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: Default to unix newline if there are no entries in
	  template list

2006-05-04 09:59  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Test to see that we don't mess with
	  unnosociated comments that have dos vs unix line endings.

2006-05-04 09:42  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: In simple case, don't minimise diff

2006-05-04 09:39  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: When merging in new comments we should
	  respect the line ending convention of the template file.

2006-05-04 09:35  friedelwolff

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Use double newlines in test for now

2006-05-04 09:22  dwaynebailey

	* filters/prefilters.py: This fixes a bug because sometimes we
	  supply 'unicode' not 'str' to the function.  This code is on a
	  critical path so I'd like someone to look at it and make it more
	  robust if possible.

	  I initially thought it might be related to multistring
	  functionality but it seems not.

2006-05-04 09:16  friedelwolff

	  extractwithoutquotes is meant to support -   a function that
	  determines whether or not to include a given escape

2006-04-28 14:12  davidfraser

	* misc/: quote.py, test_quote.py: added fix for startdelim directly
	  following enddelim (needs to handle in same loop) did same
	  enhancements to extractwithoutquotes as have been done to extract
	  took out TODO for failing test

2006-04-28 14:10  davidfraser

	* filters/prefilters.py: was overkill using a heavy tokenizer here,

2006-04-28 12:46  davidfraser

	* misc/quote.py: use find_all to precache important locations in
	  string rather than running find over and over there's some more

	  task)

	  Add test to validate that obsolete messages are placed at the
	  bottom of a pofile.

2006-03-16 01:27  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_prop2po.py: Tests to check that we place comments in
	  the correct place in PO files Test (currently disabled) to
	  validate that we are placing LOCALIZATION NOTES in KDE style
	  comments.

2006-03-16 00:40  dwaynebailey

	* convert/: po2html.py, po2moz.py, test_po2html.py, test_po2moz.py:
	  Complete po2html integration into po2moz: - Allow po2html to
	  ignore fuzzy messages when merging PO into HTML - Add stdiotell
	  wrapper for correct operation with stdout - Add xhtml as a valid
	  file type - Add xhtml parsing to po2moz - Add the start of test_
	  for po2moz and po2html

2006-03-15 23:35  friedelwolff

	* misc/wStringIO.py, storage/po.py, filters/test_pofilter.py:
	  Commit workaround for headerless po's. See
	  filters/test_pofilter.py::test_unicode

2006-03-15 21:50  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_pofilter.py: If there is no header specifying the
	  encoding then pofilter gets very confused.  This test tries to
	  parse a UTF-8 snippet and the lack of encoding information
	  confuses pofilter.

2006-03-15 21:39  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py: No need to remove variables when checking for
	  double spacing problems.

2006-03-15 21:31  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Add checks for variables that mess with
	  double spacing Another variable false positive added for later
	  correction

2006-03-15 16:44  dwaynebailey

	* convert/: html2po.py, moz2po.py, test_moz2po.py: Make moz2po work
	  with html files.  Alter html2po.py so that it works in the moz2po
	  family.

2006-03-15 13:25  davidfraser

	* convert/html2po.py: use stdiotell to prevent seek error

2006-03-15 13:24  davidfraser

	* misc/stdiotell.py: added simple wrapper for stdout that remembers
	  position

2006-03-14 21:07  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_po.py: We should be able to obsolete message when we
	  retire them, otherwise our Pootle PO files just grow and grow.

2006-03-14 20:15  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: Automatic comments are never merged,
	  they are overwritten by the new file.  Which makes sense since
	  they come from the source code and shouldn't be edited but at the
	  source.

2006-03-14 16:38  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: Separate automactic comments (#.)
	  from other comments (#[space]).  This will allow us to do more
	  Gettext like operations on our PO files such as merging #.
	  comments properly (new comment overrides the old comment)

2006-03-14 15:22  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: Test to check that we merge automatic
	  comments (#.) correctly.

2006-03-13 11:31  friedelwolff

	  to id(s)

2006-03-13 11:27  friedelwolff

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: rename source(s) (i.t.o. source
	  location) to id(s)

	* convert/test_csv2po.py, storage/csvl10n.py, storage/dtd.py,
	  storage/oo.py, storage/properties.py, tools/test_pomerge.py:
	  Rename source (i.t.o. __str__) to output

2006-03-10 15:47  friedelwolff

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: Rename source (i.t.o __str__) to
	  output

	  with specific configuration for OpenOffice.org

2006-03-08 16:33  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Add a test for a DONT_TRANSLATE case that
	  should be translated :( Probably needs to be corrected.

2006-03-08 16:20  dwaynebailey

	* convert/dtd2po.py: Now also handle cases where DONT_TRANSLATE is
	  followed by some other explanatory text

2006-03-07 23:25  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: test_dtd.py, test_properties.py: Added some tests
	  picked up during roundtripping Mozilla -> moz2po -> po2moz -> New
	  files

	  - Comments that appear on the same line as an entity definition
	  should remain in that position in our generated files - We are
	  losing hard coded \n at the start and end of properties
	  defintions

2006-03-07 22:25  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Test to check that we can handle entitie
	  reference eg &blah; in the DTD file.

2006-03-07 15:08  dwaynebailey

	* storage/html.py, convert/test_html2po.py: Allow the abbr tag to
	  be localised (Use in tables to provide abbreviated forms for the
	  content of a TH or TD tag)

2006-03-07 14:46  friedelwolff

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: Unit test and solution for multiple
	  source location styles

2006-03-07 12:22  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Som new tests that pick up problems with:
	  - endpunc - not all punctuation is considered - singlequotes - 'n
	  in Afrikaans is confusing this one when they should have been
	  removed - variabkes - entities with dots eg &file.name; are not
	  checked

2006-03-06 23:39  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py: Revert #: merging code.  It didn't work so good.

2006-03-06 23:02  dwaynebailey

	* convert/: html2po.py, test_html2po.py: Add duplicate handling to
	  html2po.  This is a good thingTM.  We can now begin to look at
	  adding xhtml as a convertor for moz2po

2006-03-06 22:29  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Add helpers countunits and compareunit
	  Convert all test to use the helpers Remove some unuseful tests
	  Add a command line testing class inheritect from test_convert Add
	  test_help

2006-03-06 12:03  dwaynebailey

	* storage/html.py: In object entities the standby attribute should
	  be translated.  The attr tags will probably come into their own
	  when we can compress entities to show a translator only the bit
	  they should change.  Till then its in here more for tracking.

2006-03-06 11:05  dwaynebailey

	* storage/html.py, convert/html2po.py, convert/test_html2po.py: Add
	  a number of new tags:  h4, h5, h6, th, dt, dd, address, caption
	  Removed:  span, lang Addeded attrs:  summary

	  This should give us full covererage of tables.  Removing 'lang'
	  removes a number of spurious errors.

	  xhtml is now a valid suffix for files processed by html2po

	  Cleanup test_html.py Made all tests work Added tests for all the
	  new tags added

2006-03-06 02:02  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Add a failing DONT_TRANSLATE style Test
	  how we handle .acceskeys that are mimatched ie don't appear in
	  .label Check the the .source is correct when we fold normal
	  access keys

2006-03-03 22:36  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py, tools/test_pomerge.py: Allow source comments to be
	  split at the line level and then merged.  This ensures that we
	  don't duplicate source locations if they appear in two different
	  styles eg one per line merged with multiple per line.

2006-03-03 15:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/: html.py, properties.py, xliff.py: Fix up accidental
	  commit of wrong files

	  Amundsen tca at gnu dot org] - Patch to allow pogrep to search in
	  other sections.

2006-03-03 09:05  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Test to ensure we can roundtrip localisation
	  notes

2006-03-03 09:01  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Extend the startcaps tests to check that
	  we can handle Unicode in the Latin Extended Additional block (ie
	  pure Unicode) (this passes) Detect entity style variables of the
	  type &blah.lable; correctly (currently fails) Add a test for
	  variables in quotes eg \"%S\" (this passes)

2006-03-02 19:56  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_csv2po.py: Whoops it actually is 'comment' not
	  'source'

2006-03-02 19:24  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_csv2po.py: Make sure we can see the source when we
	  fail checks in singleelement.  Correct the header: the first
	  column is called 'source' not 'comment'.  Make sure we test with
	  and without the header

2006-03-02 11:29  davidfraser

	* filters/: decoration.py, test_decoration.py: modified
	  decoration.find_marked_variables to be able to handle 0-length
	  variable markers (# or % in openoffice) added simple test for
	  this to new test_decoration module this now makes the checks for
	  those variables pass in test_checks

2006-03-02 11:12  davidfraser

	* convert/po2csv.py, storage/csvl10n.py, storage/test_base.py,
	  storage/test_csvl10n.py: fixed up handling spreadsheet escapes -
	  do it in the base class, not the converter also add in escapes
	  when generating source added more detailed output when error in
	  comparing sources (and fix comparing source2 units to source2
	  units instead of source1 units!)

2006-02-28 15:12  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: Ensure that we remove KDE
	  comments before checking if something is untranslated (also added
	  test) Allow numbers to be reordered (also added test Added test
	  for messages that are blank but contain a KDE comment

2006-02-28 14:52  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: always use encoding with multistring

2006-02-28 13:42  friedelwolff
