allow the user to mark strings fuzzy and write back into the input file
provide options to handle true/false
  return all that don't have empty translations
handle KDE and plural forms - in PO class
allow groups of checks: eg --test-group=critical to allow focus on certain
  types of tests. -l should show these groupings
Allow test to be disabled by default eg spelling, unless you specificly invoke
  it.  This allows certain language specific test to be always off.  Might work
  well in conjunction with test-groups and a default test-group.

bugs
  startcaps - read the locale data to determine what letters are considered
    capitals. msgid should be treated as English caps.
  accronym - multiple occurances of an acronym are not seen as an error. Ie one
    in msgid and two in msgstr, probably similarly the other way round.
  isreview, isfuzzy - are listed as having to pass the untranslated
    precondition but still appear - they should not.

other checks
  plural checks - check plural forms against the Gettext plural header
    fallback to list of valid plurals for KDE.
  Supper basic machine translation - en_GB changes color -> colour
  email: disable / check for GNOME / KDE credits entries
  
  spell checker: spell check the msgstr based on the locale and aspell/myspell
    installed on the system.  Would it work to define the language code
    properly in the PO header so that Pootle could then also check spelling of
    various files.  Might need to extend the #_ error comment to highlight what
    words had errors.
