	* allow status of input PO to override destination ie if input is not fuzzy
    and destination is fuzzy that is you corrected it then make merged message
    not fuzzy
    - A header is currently skipped.  When we can handle header merging
      a header should be merged to indicates last translators info, etc but merging 
      should be optional with ignoring being the default.
    - msgblock headers ie #: should remain unchanged.  There seems to be a bug
      that adds entries on one line when the output templates have them on
	  separate lines.
    - Allow merge without a template and thus us the output as a template.  Or
      at least don't complain when you don't find the templates.

New tools
	Some ideas for tools that would be helpful
	podiff - normal diff show too much spurious data.  We need something that
		can ignore the location and just shaw the changes in text.  So you
		could receive an updated PO file but the diff would not show spurious
		changes in the header and could match strings in different location.
		The output could then be something like diff -u
	glossary_creator - take input text or PO file and extract a) the most
		frequent words and b) the most frequent word pairs.  So things like
		"Proxy Server" are extracted. The idea being that you can create a
		glossary for a single PO file or for the whole project like KDE.
		Translators get to define important words before beginning to translate
	pomigrate - need a python based tool that takes an input file the new
		template and outputs the new migrated PO files. Initialising as needed
		and merging if possible.

pocount
	- Fix po class so that it handles KDE style plurals there not in pocount
    - Count word\nword and word<tag>word as 2 words
