#
# Stoplist of common English words to exclude from terminology
#
# Lines beginning with a '#' are comments; empty lines are ignored
#
# A line beginning with a '!' specifies upper- / lower-case mapping for words
# or phrases before comparison with this stoplist (no mapping is applied to
# the words or regex in this file, only to the source messages).  The second
# character on this line must be one of the following:
#
# 'C' no uppercase / lowercase mapping is performed
# 'F' 'Title Case" words / terms are folded to lower case (default)
# 'I' all words are mapped to lowercase 
#
# (note that this uppercase / lowercase mapping is independent of -F/-C/-I
#  arguments for case sensitivity provided to poterminology itself)
#
# Lines beginning with a '/' are regex patterns - any word that matches will
# be ignored by itself, and any phrase containing it will be ignored as well
# (note, regex patterns will NOT be checked if an exact word match is found,
# and regex patterns are always applied to individual words, not phrases)
#
# All other lines should begin with one of the following characters, which
# indicate whether the word should be ignored (as a word alone), disregarded
# in a phrase (i.e. phrase containing it is allowed, and word does not count
# against --term-word-length limit), or any phrase containing it should be
# ignored. (Note: use of '+' is only needed for exceptions to regex patterns.)
#
# '+' allow word alone, allow phrases containing it (regardless of regex match)
# ':' allow word alone, disregarded (for --term-word-length) inside phrase
# '<' allow word alone, but ignore any phrase containing it
# '=' ignore word alone, but allow phrases containing it
# '>' ignore word alone, disregarded (for --term-word-length) inside phrase
# '@' ignore word alone, and ignore any phrase containing it
#

# apply title-case folding to words before comparing with this stoplist
!F

# override regex match below for phrases with 'no'
+no

# ignore all one or two-character words (unless =word appears below)
/..?
# ignore words with parenthesis, typically function() calls and the like
/.*\(.*
# ignore numbers, both cardinal (e.g. 1,234.0) and ordinal (e.g. 1st, 22nd)
/[0-9,.]+(st|nd|rd|th)?
