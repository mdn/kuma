<a href="toolkit-pofilter.html" class="wikilink1" title="toolkit-pofilter.html">pofilter</a> allows you to check your <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> or <acronym title="XML Localization Interchange File Format">XLIFF</acronym> files for certain common errors.  This quick-start guide takes 
you through the process of using this tool, making corrections and merging your correction back into your translations.

<a href="toolkit-pofilter.html" class="wikilink1" title="toolkit-pofilter.html">pofilter</a> runs a number of checks against your translation files.  Any messages that fail are output to a set of new files (in the same structure as the source/input files).  You then edit these new/output files to correct any errors.  Once you are satisfied with your corrections these corrected files are then merged back into the original files using <a href="toolkit-pomerge.html" class="wikilink1" title="toolkit-pomerge.html">pomerge</a>.

<p>

pofilter will run all tests unless you use the -t or --excludefilter options. There are over <a href="toolkit-pofilter_tests.html" class="wikilink1" title="toolkit-pofilter_tests.html">38 tests</a> and pofilter 
can itself provide you with a current list of all the available checks:

</p>
<pre class="code">pofilter -l</pre>

<p>

We want to run the: accelerators, escapes, variables and xmltags tests as these are the ones most likely to break programs at runtime.  We are also working with OpenOffice.org <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> files created using <a href="toolkit-oo2po.html" class="wikilink1" title="toolkit-oo2po.html">oo2po</a> so we want to ensure that we set the accelerator key marker and variables definitions correctly.

</p>
<pre class="code">pofilter -t accelerators -t escapes -t variables -t xmltags --openoffice existing_files errors</pre>

<p>

Any messages that fail one of the 4 checks will be placed in files in <em>errors</em>.  We also used the <em>--openoffice</em> option to ensure that the tool is aware of the OpenOffice.org accelerator marker (<em>~</em>) and the OpenOffice.org variable styles (OpenOffice.org has over 10 variable styles).  You can also specify other styles of project including GNOME, KDE or Mozilla.
</p>

<p>
You can also specify whether you want fuzzy entries included and checked, by specifying the --fuzzy parameter. By default this is off because fuzzy strings are usually known to be broken and
will be reviewed by translators anyway.
</p>

<p>
Similarly you can include items marked for review by specifying --review or --ingnorereview.
By default review items are included.  This is not part of the standard Gettext
format. We have allowed entries like this when we want to communicate to someone
what error we have picked up:

</p>
<pre class="code"># (review) - wrong word for gallery chosen</pre>

<p>

You can run pofilter without the -t option.  This runs all the checks. This
can be confusing if you have a lot of errors as you easily lose focus.  One strategy 
is to run each test individually.  This allows you to
focus on one problem at a time across a number of files.  It is much easier to
correct end punctuation on its own then to correct many different types of
errors.  For a small file it is probably best to run all of the test together.
</p>

<p>
By using the <em>--autocorrect</em> option you can automatically correct some very common errors.  Use with caution though. This option assumes you use the same punctuation style as the source text.

<div class="level3">

<p>

Once the errors have been marked you can edit them with any text editor or <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> editor eg. <a href="guide-kbabel.html" class="wikilink1" title="guide-kbabel.html">KBabel</a> or vi.  
You will be editing the files in the <em>errors</em> directory.  Only messages that failed 
one of the tests will be present.  If no messages failed then there will be no error <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> file for the source <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> file.
Only critical errors are marked fuzzy - all others are simply marked with the pofilter marker.
Critical errors are marked fuzzy as this allows you to simply merge them back into you <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> files and then rely on the fact that
all po2* tools will ignore a message marked fuzzy.  This allows you to quickly eliminate messages that can break builds.
</p>

<p>
To edit run:

</p>
<pre class="code">vi `find errors -name &quot;*.po&quot;`
kbabel `find errors -name &quot;*.po&quot;`</pre>

<p>

or similar command.
</p>

<p>
The pofilter marker helps you determine what error was discovered:

</p>
<pre class="code"># (pofilter) &lt;test&gt; - &lt;explanation of test error&gt;</pre>

<p>

Use the test description to help you determine what is wrong with the message.  Remember that all your changes will
be ported back into the <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> files.  So if you leave a string fuzzy in the error
files, it will become fuzzy in the main files when you merge the corrected file back into the main file.  Therefore
delete anything you do not want to migrate back when you merge the files.  Delete the test comments and fuzzy markings
as needed.  Leave them in if you want another translator to see them.
</p>

<p>
The computer can get it wrong, so an error that pofilter finds may in fact not be an error.  We&#039;d like
to hear about these false positives so that we can improve the checks.  Also if you have some checks that
you have added or ideas for better checks, then let us know.

<div class="level3">

<p>

After correcting the errors in the <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> files its time to merge these corrections
back into the originals using <a href="toolkit-pomerge.html" class="wikilink1" title="toolkit-pomerge.html">pomerge</a>.

</p>
<pre class="code">pomerge -t existing_files -i errors -o files_without_errors</pre>

<p>

If -t and -o are the same directory, the corrections will be merged into the 
existing files.  Do this only if you are using some kind of version control system
so that you can check the changes made by <a href="toolkit-pomerge.html" class="wikilink1" title="toolkit-pomerge.html">pomerge</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="checking_the_corrections" id="checking_the_corrections">Checking the corrections</a></h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>

We have done this against <acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym> but you could run a normal diff between a good
copy and your modifications.  Thus we assume in the last step that we merged
the corrections into the existing translations:

</p>
<pre class="code">pomerge -t existing_files -i errors -o existing_files</pre>

<p>

Now we check the changes using <em>cvs diff</em>:

</p>
<pre class="code">cvs diff -u existing_files &gt; x.diff</pre>

<p>

This creates a unified diff (one with + and - lines so you can see what was
added and what was removed) in the file x.diff

</p>
<pre class="code">vim x.diff</pre>

<p>

Check the diff file in any editor, here we use vim.  You should check to see
that the changes you requested are going in and that something major did not go
wrong.  Also look to see if you haven&#039;t left any lines with ”# (pofilter): test description”
which should have been deleted from the error checking <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym> files.  Also check
for stray fuzzy markers that shouldn&#039;t have been added.  You will have to make 
corrections in the files in <em>existing_files</em> not in <em>errors</em>.
</p>

<p>
When you are happy that the changes are correct run:

</p>
<pre class="code">cvs ci existing_files</pre>

<p>

Congratulations you have helped eliminate a number of errors that could give problems
when running the application.  Now you might want to look at
running some of the other tests that check for style and uniformity in translation.
