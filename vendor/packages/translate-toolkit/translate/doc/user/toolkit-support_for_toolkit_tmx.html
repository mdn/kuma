<h2><a name="support_for_tmx" id="support_for_tmx">Support for TMX</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

Although <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym> is supposed to be an exchange standard, not all tools create or read standard <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym> files, and consequently some tools may not be able to use the Toolkit&#039;s TMXes and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Have a good Unicode editor handy so that you can fiddle with the encoding of the file in extreme cases.  For <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Windows users, we suggest Babelpad.

<h4><a name="how_they_were_tested" id="how_they_were_tested">How they were tested</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

I tested other tools by checking if they import Toolkit TMXes without complaint, and in some cases if I could get translation matches from it.  I tested their TMXes with the Toolkit by doing a pocount on the <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym> and doing a pot2po (with --tm=file.tmx) on a file with known matches.

<h4><a name="cafetran_2007" id="cafetran_2007">Cafetran 2007</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Seems fully compatible with Tranlate-toolkit, in both directions.  Cafetran imports our <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym> without complaints.  A Cafetran user was able to read and use one of our TMXes, and we were able to test and use one of the Cafetran user&#039;s TMXes.

<h4><a name="wordfast_5" id="wordfast_5">Wordfast 5</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Fully compatible with Translate-toolkit.  Wordfast opens our TMXes directly and converts them to its own internal format.  Wordfast can also export to <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym>, which can be read by our tools.  Remember, Wordfast&#039;s Unicode format is UTF16LE with BOM, so if you run into problems, try converting it by character encoding.  Wordfast 3 and 4 should also work.

<h4><a name="trados_2007_workbench_8" id="trados_2007_workbench_8">Trados 2007 (Workbench 8)</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Possibly compatible with Translate-toolkit.  To import using Trados, first create a Trados TM and then import the <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym> into it.  Trados did import our test <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym> (22000 segments) but it lost about 30% of the segments in the process.  Our tools can read TMXes exported from Trados.
</p>

<h4><a name="omegat_1.6" id="omegat_1.6">OmegaT 1.6</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Fully compatible with Translate-toolkit.  Simply place our TMXes in the /tm/ folder of your project.  All of OmegaT&#039;s exported TMXes can be read by the Translate-toolkit -- although which one you use will depend on what your workflow is (i.e. with OmegaT&#039;s internal tags or without them).

<p>

Actually, this tool is still in beta and it kept crashing when I tested it, but I was able to discover one thing:  the <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym> <acronym title="Document Type Definition">DTD</acronym> (called tmx14.dtd) must be in the same folder as the <acronym title="Translation Memory eXchange">TMX</acronym> file you&#039;re trying to import.

This tool was too big for me to test (several hundreds of megabytes).
