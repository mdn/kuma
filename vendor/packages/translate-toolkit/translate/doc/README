User documentation
==================
The files under the user/ directory is user documentation that is generated 
from the translate toolkit section of the Translate wiki at
  http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/toolkit/index

The online versions should always be more up to date, but might already reflect
changes in versions newer than the one you downloaded. Please contribute to the
wiki rather than working on these files here.

API documenation
================
The files under the api/ directory is API documentation for programmers that 
want to use the toolkit as a library. It is generated with epydoc as part of
the release process. The files packaged with a released version corresponds to 
that particular release. You might want to make sure where current developement
is heading and rather work against the current development trunk in version 
control.
