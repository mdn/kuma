This directory contains miscellaneous code for translate
It includes code written specifically for translate
and also other modules that are included with Python 2.3
but have been included here for backwards compatibility with
earlier versions of Python.

translate is distributed under the GPL; some of the code in this
directory is distributed under other open source licenses.
Please see each relevant file for details...

quote.py is a standard translate module that is used for quoting/unquoting
and escaping/unescaping strings. It is released under the GPL

The csv module is defined in csv.py and _csv.c
Since some of this code is in C, it needs to be compiled and installed
on your Python distribution if you are using a version of Python before 
Python 2.3. To do this, run:
  setup.py install
(This will require the standard C compiler for your operating system)

optparse.py is the standard Python command line options parser, previously
known as Optik. It also requires textwrap.py which is a standard Python 2.3
module, and which is also included here.
