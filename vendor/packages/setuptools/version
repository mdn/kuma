# This is a PEAK 'version' tool configuration file, that's
# also executable.  PJE uses it to bump version numbers in
# the various parts of the project without having to edit them
# by hand.  The current version is stored in the version.dat
# file.  

# These are not the droids you're looking for.  You can go on
# about your business...
