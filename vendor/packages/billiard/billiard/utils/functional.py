### Begin from Python 2.5 functools.py ########################################

# Summary of changes made to the Python 2.5 code below:
#   * swapped ``partial`` for ``curry`` to maintain backwards-compatibility
#     in Django.
#   * Wrapped the ``setattr`` call in ``update_wrapper`` with a try-except
#     block to make it compatible with Python 2.3, which doesn't allow
#     assigning to ``__name__``.
