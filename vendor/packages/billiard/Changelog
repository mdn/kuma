0.3.1 [2010-05-24 08:30 P.M CEST]
---------------------------------

* Fixed broken bool evaluation in supervisor. Thanks to jonozzz

    The bug originated from a ``a if x else b`` vs. ``x and a or bz`` confusion
    when porting code to Python 2.4.

* ``ApplyResult._set`` can't delete the result if it's not been accepted.

    This also means ``ApplyResult._ack`` needs to delete the result if the
    job has been marked ready.

0.3.0 [2010-05-15 03:00 P.M CEST]
---------------------------------

* Added support for accept callbacks.

---------------------------------

* Python 2.4 support.
