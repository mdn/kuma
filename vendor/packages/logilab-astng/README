ASTNG
=====

What's this ?
-------------

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
governed by pylint's needs.

Since 0.18, it provides a compatible representation which may come
from the `compiler` module (for python <= 2.4) pr the `_ast` module
(for python >= 2.5).

It rebuilds the tree generated by the compiler.ast [1] module or by
the builtin _ast module by recursively walking down the AST and
building an extended ast (let's call it astng ;). The new node classes
have additional methods and attributes for different usages.
They include some support for static inference and local name scopes.
Furthermore, astng builds partial trees by inspecting living objects.

Main modules are:

* `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the
  different type of nodes of the tree.

* the `manager` contains a high level object to get astng trees from
  source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
  constructed tree for quick access
