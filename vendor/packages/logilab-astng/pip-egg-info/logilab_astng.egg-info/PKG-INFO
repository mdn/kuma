Description: The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
        pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
        governed by pylint's needs.
        
        It rebuilds the tree generated by the compiler.ast [1] module (python <= 2.4)
        or by the builtin _ast module (python >= 2.5) by recursively walking down the
        AST and building an extended ast (let's call it astng ;). The new node classes
        have additional methods and attributes for different usages.
        Furthermore, astng builds partial trees by inspecting living objects.
