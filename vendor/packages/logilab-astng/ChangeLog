    * fix #20464: raises “TypeError: '_Yes' object is not iterable” on list inference

    * fix name error making 0.19.2 almost useless



2009-12-18  --  0.19.2

    * fix #9515: strange message for non-class "Class baz has no egg member" (due to
      bad inference of function call)

    * api change to be able to infer using a context (used to infer function call
      result only for now)

    * slightly better inference on astng built from living object by trying to infer
      dummy nodes (able to infer 'help' builtin for instance)

    * external attribute definition support

    * grrr, fixed python 2.3 incompatibility introduced by generator expression
      scope handling

    * fix [Class|Module].block_range method (this fixes pylint's inline
      disabling of messages on classes/modules)

    * patch transformer to extract correct line information



2006-04-19  --  0.16.0

      a class instead of a data descriptor

2006-03-10  --  0.15.1
    * fix avoiding to load everything from living objects... Thanks Amaury!

    * fix a possible NameError in Instance.infer_call_result



2006-03-06  --  0.15.0
    * fix possible infinite recursion on global statements (close #10342)
      and in various other cases...

    * fix locals/globals interactions when the global statement is used
      (close #10434)

    * multiple inference related bug fixes

    * associate List, Tuple and Dict and Const nodes to their respective
      classes

    * new .ass_type method on assignment related node, returning the
      assignment type node (Assign, For, ListCompFor, GenExprFor,
      TryExcept)

    * more API refactoring... .resolve method has disappeared, now you
      have .ilookup on every nodes and .getattr/.igetattr on node
      supporting the attribute protocol

    * introduced a YES object that may be returned when there is ambiguity
      on an inference path (typically function call when we don't know
      arguments value)

    * builder try to instantiate builtin exceptions subclasses to get their
      instance attribute



2006-01-10  --  0.14.0
    * some major inference improvements and refactoring ! The drawback is
      the introduction of some non backward compatible change in the API
      but it's imho much cleaner and powerful now :)

    * new boolean property .newstyle on Class nodes (implements #10073)

    * new .import_module method on Module node to help in .resolve
      refactoring

    * .instance_attrs has list of assignments to instance attribute
      dictionary as value instead of one

    * added missing GenExprIf and GenExprInner nodes, and implements
      as_string for each generator expression related nodes

    * specifically catch KeyboardInterrupt to reraise it in some places

    * fix so that module names are always absolute

    * fix .resolve on package where a subpackage is imported in the
      __init__ file

    * fix a bug regarding construction of Function node from living object
      with earlier version of python 2.4

    * fix a NameError on Import and From self_resolve method

    * fix a bug occurring when building an astng from a living object with
      a property

    * lint fixes



2005-11-07  --  0.13.1
    * fix bug on building from living module the same object in
      encountered more than once time (e.g. builtins.object) (close #10069)

    * fix bug in Class.ancestors() regarding inner classes (close #10072)

    * fix .self_resolve() on From and Module nodes to handle package
      precedence over module (close #10066)

    * locals dict for package contains __path__ definition (close #10065)

    * astng provide GenExpr and GenExprFor nodes with python >= 2.4
      (close #10063)

    * fix python2.2 compatibility (close #9922)

    * link .__contains__ to .has_key on scoped node to speed up execution

    * remove no more necessary .module_object() method on From and Module
      nodes

    * normalize parser.ParserError to SyntaxError with python 2.2



2005-10-21  --  0.13.0
    * .locals  and .globals on scoped node handle now a list of references
       to each assignment statements instead of a single reference to the
       first assignment statement.

    * fix bug with manager.astng_from_module_name when a context file is
      given (notably fix ZODB 3.4 crash with pylint/pyreverse)

    * fix Compare.as_string method

    * fix bug with lambda object missing the "type" attribute

    * some minor refactoring

    * This package has been extracted from the logilab-common package, which
      will be kept for some time for backward compatibility but will no
      longer be maintained (this explains that this package is starting with
      the 0.13 version number, since the fork occurs with the version
      released in logilab-common 0.12).
