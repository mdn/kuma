# setup.py for coverage.

"""Code coverage measurement for Python

Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses
the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard
library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.

Coverage.py runs on Pythons 2.3 through 3.1.

Documentation is at `nedbatchelder.com <%s>`_.  Code repository and issue
tracker are at `bitbucket.org <http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy>`_.

New in 3.2: Branch coverage!
