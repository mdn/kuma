.. _reference.feed.ttl:

:py:attr:`feed.ttl`
===================

According to the :abbr:`RSS (Rich Site Summary)` specification, "None"

No one is quite sure what this means, and no one publishes feeds via
file-sharing networks.

Some clients have interpreted this element to be some sort of inline caching
mechanism, albeit one that completely ignores the underlying :abbr:`HTTP
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)` protocol, its robust caching mechanisms, and the
huge amount of :abbr:`HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)`-savvy network
infrastructure that understands them.  Given the vague documentation, it is
impossible to say that this interpretation is any more ridiculous than the
element itself.
