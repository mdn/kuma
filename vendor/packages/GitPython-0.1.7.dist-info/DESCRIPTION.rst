GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories.

GitPython provides object model access to your git repository. Once you have
created a repository object, you can traverse it to find parent commit(s),
trees, blobs, etc.

GitPython is a port of the grit library in Ruby created by 
Tom Preston-Werner and Chris Wanstrath.
