"""Emacs and Flymake compatible Pylint.

This script is for integration with emacs and is compatible with flymake mode.

This version of epylint traverses out of packages before invoking pylint.  This avoids the reporting
of errors that occur when a module within package uses a full package import path to get hold of
another module within this package.

For example:
    - Suppose a package is structured as

        a/__init__.py
        a/b/x.py
        a/c/y.py

   - Then if y.py imports x as "from a.b import x" the following produces pylint errors

       cd a/c; pylint y.py

   - The following obviously doesn't

       pylint a/c/y.py

   - As this script will be invoked by emacs within the directory of the file we are checking
     we need to traverse down out of it to avoid these false positives.


You may also use py_run to run pylint with desired options and get back (or not) its output.

    When run from emacs we will be in the directory of a file, and passed its filename.
    If this file is part of a package and is trying to import other modules from within
    its own package or another package rooted in a directory below it, pylint will classify
    it as a failed import.

    To get around this, we traverse down the directory tree to find the root of the package this
    module is in.  We then invoke pylint from this directory.

    Finally, we must correct the filenames in the output generated by pylint so Emacs doesn't
    become confused (it will expect just the original filename, while pylint may extend it with
    extra directories if we've traversed down the tree)
