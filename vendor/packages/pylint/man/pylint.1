.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pylint 
is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming
errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code
smells (as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book)

Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you
can do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. However, Pylint
offers some more features, like checking length of lines of code,
checking if variable names are well-formed according to your coding
standard, or checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented,
and much more.

Additionally, it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--version"
show program's version number and exit
.IP "--help, -h"
show this help message and exit

.SH MASTER
.IP "--rcfile=<file>"
Specify a configuration file.
.IP "--init-hook=<code>"
Python code to execute, usually for sys.path manipulation such as pygtk.require().
.IP "--errors-only, -e"
In debug mode, checkers without error messages are disabled and for others, only the ERROR messages are displayed, and no reports are done by default
.IP "--profile=<y_or_n>"
Profiled execution. [current: no]
.IP "--ignore=<file>"
Add <file or directory> to the black list. It should be a base name, not a path. You may set this option multiple times. [current: CVS]
.IP "--persistent=<y_or_n>"
Pickle collected data for later comparisons. [current: yes]
.IP "--load-plugins=<modules>"
List of plugins (as comma separated values of python modules names) to load, usually to register additional checkers. [current: none]

.SH COMMANDS
.IP "--help-msg=<msg-id>"
Display a help message for the given message id and exit. The value may be a comma separated list of message ids.
.IP "--list-msgs"
Generate pylint's full documentation.
.IP "--generate-rcfile"
Generate a sample configuration file according to the current configuration. You can put other options before this one to get them in the generated configuration.
.IP "--generate-man"

None.                                                                 

.SH OUTPUT

Using the default text output, the message format is :

    * (R) refactor, for bad code smell                                         
    * (W) warning, for python specific problems
