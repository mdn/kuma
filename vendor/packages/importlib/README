Purpose
========

This package contains the code from importlib as found in Python 2.7. It is
provided so that people who wish to use importlib.import_module() with a
version of Python prior to 2.7 or in 3.0 have the function readily available.
The code in no way deviates from what can be found in the 2.7 trunk.

For documentation, see the `importlib docs`_ for Python 2.7.
