Changelog
=========


0.5.0 (2010-02-17)
------------------

* Changed the ``--count`` switch to print to sys.stderr and set
  exit code to 1 if any error or warning is found.

* E241 and E242 are removed from the standard checks. If you want to
  include these checks, use switch ``--select=E,W``. (Issue #4)

* Blank line is not mandatory before the first class method or nested
  function definition, even if there's a docstring. (Issue #1)

* Add the switch ``--version``.

* Fix decoding errors with Python 3. (Issue #13 [1]_)

* Add ``--select`` option which is mirror of ``--ignore``.

* Add checks E261 and E262 for spaces before inline comments.

* New check W604 warns about deprecated usage of backticks.

* New check W603 warns about the deprecated operator ``<>``.

* Performance improvement, due to rewriting of E225.

* E225 now accepts:

  - no whitespace after unary operator or similar. (Issue #9 [1]_)

  - lambda function with argument unpacking or keyword defaults.

* Reserve "2 blank lines" for module-level logical blocks. (E303)

* Allow multi-line comments. (E302, issue #10 [1]_)


0.4.2 (2009-10-22)
------------------

* Decorators on classes and class methods are OK now.

----------------

* Support for all versions of Python from 2.3 to 3.1.

* New and greatly expanded self tests.

* Further improvements to the handling of comments and blank lines.
  (Issue #1 [1]_ and others changes.)

  #2 [1]_). This also prevents an exception when traversing directories
  with non ``*.py`` files.

* E231 should allow commas to be followed by ``)``. (Issue #3 [1]_)

* Spaces are not longer required around the equals sign for keyword
  arguments or default parameter values.
