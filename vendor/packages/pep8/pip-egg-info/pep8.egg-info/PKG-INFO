Description: pep8 - Python style guide checker
        =================================
        
        pep8 is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style
        conventions in `PEP 8`_.
        
        .. _PEP 8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
        
        
        Mailing List
        ------------
        http://groups.google.com/group/pep8
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Plugin architecture: Adding new checks is easy.
        
        * Parseable output: Jump to error location in your editor.
        
        * Small: Just one Python file, requires only stdlib. You can use just
        the pep8.py file for this purpose.
        
        * Easy_installable, of course!
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just an ``easy_install pep8`` ought to do the trick.
        
        
        Example usage and output
        ------------------------
        
        ::
        
        $ pep8 optparse.py
        optparse.py:69:11: E401 multiple imports on one line
        optparse.py:77:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
        optparse.py:88:5: E301 expected 1 blank line, found 0
        optparse.py:222:34: W602 deprecated form of raising exception
        optparse.py:347:31: E211 whitespace before '('
        optparse.py:357:17: E201 whitespace after '{'
        optparse.py:472:29: E221 multiple spaces before operator
        optparse.py:544:21: W601 .has_key() is deprecated, use 'in'
        
        You can also make pep8.py show the source code for each error, and
        even the relevant text from PEP 8::
        
        $ pep8 --show-source --show-pep8 testsuite/E111.py
        testsuite/E111.py:2:3: E111 indentation is not a multiple of four
        print x
        ^
        Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
        
        For really old code that you don't want to mess up, you can
        continue to use 8-space tabs.
        
        Or you can display how often each error was found::
        
        $ pep8 --statistics -qq --filename=*.py Python-2.5/Lib
        232     E201 whitespace after '['
        599     E202 whitespace before ')'
        631     E203 whitespace before ','
        842     E211 whitespace before '('
        2531    E221 multiple spaces before operator
        4473    E301 expected 1 blank line, found 0
        4006    E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
        165     E303 too many blank lines (4)
        325     E401 multiple imports on one line
        3615    E501 line too long (82 characters)
        612     W601 .has_key() is deprecated, use 'in'
        1188    W602 deprecated form of raising exception
        
        Quick help is available on the command line::
        
        $ pep8 -h
        Usage: pep8.py [options] input ...
        
        Options:
        --version            show program's version number and exit
        -h, --help           show this help message and exit
        -v, --verbose        print status messages, or debug with -vv
        -q, --quiet          report only file names, or nothing with -qq
        -r, --repeat         show all occurrences of the same error
        --exclude=patterns   exclude files or directories which match these comma
        separated patterns (default: .svn,CVS,.bzr,.hg,.git)
        --filename=patterns  when parsing directories, only check filenames matching
        these comma separated patterns (default: *.py)
        --select=errors      select errors and warnings (e.g. E,W6)
        --ignore=errors      skip errors and warnings (e.g. E4,W)
        --show-source        show source code for each error
        --show-pep8          show text of PEP 8 for each error
        --statistics         count errors and warnings
        --count              print total number of errors and warnings to standard
        error and set exit code to 1 if total is not null
        --benchmark          measure processing speed
        --testsuite=dir      run regression tests from dir
        --doctest            run doctest on myself

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        0.5.0 (2010-02-17)
        ------------------
        
        * Changed the ``--count`` switch to print to sys.stderr and set
        exit code to 1 if any error or warning is found.
        
        * E241 and E242 are removed from the standard checks. If you want to
        include these checks, use switch ``--select=E,W``. (Issue #4)
        
        * Blank line is not mandatory before the first class method or nested
        function definition, even if there's a docstring. (Issue #1)
        
        * Add the switch ``--version``.
        
        * Fix decoding errors with Python 3. (Issue #13 [1]_)
        
        * Add ``--select`` option which is mirror of ``--ignore``.
        
        * Add checks E261 and E262 for spaces before inline comments.
        
        * New check W604 warns about deprecated usage of backticks.
        
        * New check W603 warns about the deprecated operator ``<>``.
        
        * Performance improvement, due to rewriting of E225.
        
        * E225 now accepts:
        
        - no whitespace after unary operator or similar. (Issue #9 [1]_)
        
        - lambda function with argument unpacking or keyword defaults.
        
        * Reserve "2 blank lines" for module-level logical blocks. (E303)
        
        * Allow multi-line comments. (E302, issue #10 [1]_)
        
        
        0.4.2 (2009-10-22)
        ------------------
        
        * Decorators on classes and class methods are OK now.
        
        
        0.4 (2009-10-20)
        ----------------
        
        * Support for all versions of Python from 2.3 to 3.1.
        
        * New and greatly expanded self tests.
        
        * Added ``--count`` option to print the total number of errors and warnings.
        
        * Further improvements to the handling of comments and blank lines.
        (Issue #1 [1]_ and others changes.)
        
        * Check all py files in directory when passed a directory (Issue
        #2 [1]_). This also prevents an exception when traversing directories
        with non ``*.py`` files.
        
        * E231 should allow commas to be followed by ``)``. (Issue #3 [1]_)
        
        * Spaces are not longer required around the equals sign for keyword
        arguments or default parameter values.
