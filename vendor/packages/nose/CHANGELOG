- **All new documentation!** nose's documentation is now generated by
  Sphinx. And thanks to Pam Zerbinos, it is much better organized and easier
  to use and read.
- Two new core commandline options can help with testing namespace
  packages. :option:`--first-package-wins` is useful when you want to test one
  part of a namespace package that uses another part; in previous versions of
  nose, the other part of the namespace package would be evicted from
  sys.modules when the 2nd loaded. :option:`--traverse-namespace` is useful if
  you want nose to discover tests across entries in a package's
  __path__. (This was formerly the default behavior).
- To make it easier to use custom plugins without needing setuptools,
  :func:`nose.core.main` and :func:`nose.core.run` now support an
  :doc:`addplugins <doc_tests/test_addplugins/test_addplugins>` keyword
  argument that takes a list of additional plugins to make available. **Note**
  that adding a plugin to this list **does not** activate or enable the
  plugin, only makes it available to be enabled via command-line or
  config file settings.
- Thanks to Kevin Mitchell, nose is now more compatible with
  IronPython. IronPython is still not fully supported, but it should work. If
  you'd like to improve nose's support for IronPython further, please join the
  nose developer's list and volunteer to become the IronPython maintainer for
  nose!
- Added multiprocess plugin that allows tests to be run in parallel
  across multiple processes.

  Fackler for the patch.
- Added plugin that enables collection of tests in all modules. Thanks to
  Peter Fein for the patch (#137).

  any tests failed in the previous test run (so long as testid was active for
  that test run) only the failed tests will run.
- Made it possible to 'yield test' in addition to 'yield test,' from test
  generators. Thanks to Chad Whitacre for the patch (#230).

  @deferred decorator that makes it simple to write deferred tests, with or
  without timeouts.

  when the two plugins are used together. Thanks to David Avraamides for the
  bug report.
- Added isolation plugin. Use this plugin to automatically restore sys.modules
  after each test module or package. Thanks to Michal Kwiatkowski for the
  feature request.

  matching the behavior of coverage.py on the command line. Thanks to Bill
  Zingler for the bug report.
- Added a man page for nosetests. Thanks to Gustavo Noronha Silva for the
  request and providing an example.

0.9.1

- New function nose.runmodule() finds and runs tests only in a
  single module, which defaults to __main__ (like unittest.main() or
  doctest.runmodule()). Thanks Greg Wilson for the suggestion.
- Multiple -w (--where) arguments can now be used in one command line,
  to find and run tests in multiple locations. Thanks Titus Brown for
  the suggestion.
- Multiple --include and --exclude arguments are now accepted in one command
  line. Thanks Michal Kwiatkowski for the feature request.
- Coverage will now include modules not imported by any test when
  using the new --cover-inclusive switch. Thanks James Casbon for the
  patch.
- module:TestClass test selections now properly select all tests in the test
  class.
- startTest and stopTest are now called in plugins at the beginning and end of
  test suites, including test modules, as well as individual tests. Thanks
  Michal Kwiatkowski for the suggestion.

  passing through and being used as the test name selection. Thanks Kumar
  McMillan for the bug report.
- Fix bug in handling of -x/--stop option where the test run would stop on
  skipped or deprecated tests. Thanks Kumar McMillan for the bug report.

  Windows. Add --noexe option so windows users can turn if off.Thanks
  richard at artsalliancemedia dot com for the bug reports.
- Handle a working directory that happens to be in the middle of a package
  more gracefully. Thanks Max Ischenko for the bug report and test case.

  and methods, instead of callable(). Thanks to Kumar McMillan for reporting
  the bug.
- Fix doctest plugin: return an empty iterable when no tests are found in a
  directory instead of None. Thanks to Kumar McMillan for the bug report and
  patch.
- Ignore executable python modules, unless run with --exe file. This is a
  partial defense against nose causing trouble by loading python modules that
  are not import-safe. The full defense: don't write modules that aren't
  import safe!
- Catch and warn about errors on plugin load instead of dying.
- Renamed builtin profile module from nose.plugins.profile to
  nose.plugins.prof to avoid shadowing stdlib profile.py module.

0.9.0a1

- Add support for plugins, with hooks for selecting, loading and reporting on
  tests. Doctest and coverage are now plugins.
- Add builtin plugins for profiling with hotshot, selecting tests by
  attribute (contributed by Mika Eloranta), and warning of missed tests
  specified on command line.
- Change command line test selection syntax to match unittest. Thanks to Titus
  Brown for the suggestion.
- Option to drop into pdb on error or failure.
- Option to stop running on first error or failure. Thanks to Kevin Dangoor
  for the suggestion.
- Support for doctests in files other than python modules (python 2.4 only)
- Reimplement base test selection as single self-contained class.
- Reimplement test loading as unittest-compatible TestLoader class.
- Remove all monkeypatching.
- Reimplement output capture and assert introspection support in
  unittest-compatible Result class.
- Better support for multiline constructions in assert introspection.
- More context output with assert introspections.
- Refactor setuptools test command support to use proxied result, which
  enables output capture and assert introspection support without
  monkeypatching. Thanks to Philip J. Eby for the suggestion and skeleton
  implementation.
- Add support for generators in test classes. Thanks to Jay Parlar for the
  suggestion and patch.
- Add nose.tools package with some helpful test-composition functions and
  decorators, including @raises, contributed by Scot Doyle.
- Reimplement nose.main (TestProgram) to have unittest-compatible signature.
- All-new import path handling. You can even turn it off! (If you don't,
  nose will ensure that all directories from which it imports anything are on
  sys.path before the import.)
- Logging package used for verbose logging.
- Support for skipped and deprecated tests.
- Configuration is no longer global.

0.8.7

- Add support for py.test-style test generators. Thanks to Jay Parlar for
  the suggestion.
- Fix bug in doctest discovery. Thanks to Richard Cooper for the bug report.
- Fix bug in output capture being appended to later exceptions. Thanks to
  Titus Brown for the patch that uncovered the bug.
- Fix bug(?) in Exception patch that caused masked hasattr/__getattr__ loops
  to either become actual infinite loops, or at least take so long to finally
  error out that they might as well be infinite.
- Add -m option to restrict test running to only tests in a particular package
  or module. Like the -f option, -m does not restrict test *loading*, only
  test *execution*.
- When loading and running a test module, ensure that the module's path is in
  sys.path for the duration of the run, not just while importing the module.
- Add id() method to all callable test classes, for greater unittest
  compatibility.

0.8.6

- Fix bug with coverage output when sys.modules contains entries without
  __file__ attributes
- Added -p (--cover-packages) switch that may be used to restrict coverage
  report to modules in the indicated package(s)

0.8.5

- Output capture and verbose assertion errors now work when run like
  'python setup.py test', as advertised.
- Code coverage improvements: now coverage will be output for all modules
  imported by any means that were not in sys.modules at the start of the test
  run. By default, test modules will be excluded from the coverage report, but
  you can include them with the -t (--cover-tests) option.

0.8.4

- Fix bugs in handling of setup/teardown fixtures that could cause TypeError
  exceptions in fixtures to be silently ignored, or multiple fixtures of the
  same type to run. Thanks to Titus Brown for the bug report.

0.8.3

- Add -V (--version) switch to nosetests
- Fix bug where sys.path would not be set up correctly when running some
  tests, producing spurious import errors (Thanks to Titus Brown and Mike
  Thomson for the bug reports)
- For test classses not derived from unittest.TestCase, output (module.Class)
  "doc string" as test description, when method doc string is available
  (Thanks to David Keeney for the suggestion, even if this isn't quite what he
  meant)

0.8.2

- Revise import to bypass sys.path and manipulate sys.modules more
  intelligently, ensuring that the test module we think we are loading is the
  module we actually load, and that modules loaded by other imports are not
  reloaded without cause
- Allow test directories inside of packages. Formerly directories matching
  testMatch but lacking an __init__.py would cause an ImportError when located
  inside of packages
- Fix bugs in different handling of -f switch in combination with -w and -o

0.8.1

- Fix bug in main() that resulted in incorrect exit status for nosetests
  script when tests fail
- Add missing test files to MANIFEST.in
- Miscellaneous pylint cleanups

0.8

- Add doctest support
- Add optional code coverage support, using Ned Batchelder's coverage.py;
  activate with --coverage switch or NOSE_COVERAGE environment variable
- More informative error message on import error
- Fix bug where module setup could be called twice and teardown skipped
  for certain setup method names.
- main() returns success value, does not exit. run_exit() added to support
  old behavior; nosetests script now calls nose.run_exit()

0.7.5

- Fix bus error on exit
- Discover tests inside of non-TestCase classes that match testMatch
- Reorganize selftest: now selftest tests the output of a full nose run
- Add test_with_setup.py contributed by Kumar McMillan

0.7.2

- Refactor and correct bugs in discovery and test loading
- Reorganize and expand documentation
- Add -f (run this test file only) switch

0.7.1

- Bugfix release: test files in root of working directory were not being
  stripped of file extension before import.

0.7

- Change license to LGPL
- Major rework of output capture and assert introspection
- Improve test discovery: now finds tests in packages
- Replace -n switch ('no cwd') with -w switch ('look here')

0.6

- New nosetests script
- Allow specification of names on command line that are loadable but not
  directly loadable as modules (eg nosetests -o path/to/tests.py)
- Add optional py.test-like assert introspection. Thanks to Kevin Dangoor
  for the suggestion.
- Improvements to selftest

0.5.1

- Increased compatibility with python 2.3 (and maybe earlier)
- Increased compatibility with tests written for py.test: now calls
  module.setup_module(module) if module.setup_module() fails
