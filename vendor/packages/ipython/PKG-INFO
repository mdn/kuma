Description: 
        The goal of IPython is to create a comprehensive environment for
        interactive and exploratory computing.  To support this goal, IPython
        has two main components:
        
        * An enhanced interactive Python shell.
        
        * An architecture for interactive parallel computing.
        
        The enhanced interactive Python shell has the following main features:
        
        * Comprehensive object introspection.
        
        * Input history, persistent across sessions.
        
        * Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
        references.
        
        * Readline based name completion.
        
        * Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
        performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.
        
        * Configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler
        than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).
        
        * Session logging and reloading.
        
        * Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.
        
        * Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.
        
        * Easily embeddable in other Python programs and wxPython GUIs.
        
        * Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.
        
        The parallel computing architecture has the following main features:
        
        * Quickly parallelize Python code from an interactive Python/IPython session.
        
        * A flexible and dynamic process model that be deployed on anything from
        multicore workstations to supercomputers.
        
        * An architecture that supports many different styles of parallelism, from
        message passing to task farming.
        
        * Both blocking and fully asynchronous interfaces.
        
        * High level APIs that enable many things to be parallelized in a few lines
        of code.
        
        * Share live parallel jobs with other users securely.
        
        * Dynamically load balanced task farming system.
        
        * Robust error handling in parallel code.
        
        The latest development version is always available from IPython's `Launchpad
        site <http://launchpad.net/ipython>`_.
