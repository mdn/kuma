IPython is led by Fernando Pérez.

As of this writing, the following developers have joined the core team:

* [Robert Kern] <rkern-AT-enthought.com>: co-mentored the 2005
  Google Summer of Code project to develop python interactive
  notebooks (XML documents) and graphical interface. This project
  was awarded to the students Tzanko Matev <tsanko-AT-gmail.com> and
  Toni Alatalo <antont-AT-an.org>.

* [Brian Granger] <ellisonbg-AT-gmail.com>: extending IPython to allow
  support for interactive parallel computing.

* [Benjamin (Min) Ragan-Kelley]: key work on IPython's parallel
  computing infrastructure.

* [Ville Vainio] <vivainio-AT-gmail.com>: Ville has made many improvements
  to the core of IPython and was the maintainer of the main IPython
  trunk from version 0.7.1 to 0.8.4.

* [Gael Varoquaux] <gael.varoquaux-AT-normalesup.org>: work on the merged
  architecture for the interpreter as of version 0.9, implementing a new WX GUI
  based on this system.

* [Barry Wark] <barrywark-AT-gmail.com>: implementing a new Cocoa GUI, as well
  as work on the new interpreter architecture and Twisted support.

* [Laurent Dufrechou] <laurent.dufrechou-AT-gmail.com>: development of the WX
  GUI support.

* [Jörgen Stenarson] <jorgen.stenarson-AT-bostream.nu>: maintainer of the
  PyReadline project, necessary for IPython under windows.


The IPython project is also very grateful to:

Bill Bumgarner <bbum-AT-friday.com>: for providing the DPyGetOpt module
which gives very powerful and convenient handling of command-line
options (light years ahead of what Python 2.1.1's getopt module does).

Ka-Ping Yee <ping-AT-lfw.org>: for providing the Itpl module for
convenient and powerful string interpolation with a much nicer syntax
than formatting through the '%' operator.

Arnd Baecker <baecker-AT-physik.tu-dresden.de>: for his many very useful
suggestions and comments, and lots of help with testing and
documentation checking. Many of IPython's newer features are a result of
discussions with him (bugs are still my fault, not his).

Obviously Guido van Rossum and the whole Python development team, that
goes without saying.

IPython's website is generously hosted at http://ipython.scipy.orgby
Enthought (http://www.enthought.com). I am very grateful to them and all
of the SciPy team for their contribution.

Fernando would also like to thank Stephen Figgins <fig-AT-monitor.net>,
an O'Reilly Python editor. His Oct/11/2001 article about IPP and
LazyPython, was what got this project started. You can read it at:
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2001/10/11/pythonnews.html.

And last but not least, all the kind IPython users who have emailed new code,
bug reports, fixes, comments and ideas. A brief list follows, please let us

  core prefilter stuff in the IPython interpreter.

  Jack is also contributing with Debian packaging and many other
  things.
