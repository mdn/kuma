"""hooks for IPython.

In Python, it is possible to overwrite any method of any object if you really
want to.  But IPython exposes a few 'hooks', methods which are _designed_ to
be overwritten by users for customization purposes.  This module defines the
default versions of all such hooks, which get used by IPython if not
overridden by the user.

hooks are simple functions, but they should be declared with 'self' as their
first argument, because when activated they are registered into IPython as
instance methods.  The self argument will be the IPython running instance
itself, so hooks have full access to the entire IPython object.

If you wish to define a new hook and activate it, you need to put the
necessary code into a python file which can be either imported or execfile()'d
from within your ipythonrc configuration.

For example, suppose that you have a module called 'myiphooks' in your
PYTHONPATH, which contains the following definition:

import os
import IPython.ipapi
ip = IPython.ipapi.get()

def calljed(self,filename, linenum):
    "My editor hook calls the jed editor directly."
    print "Calling my own editor, jed ..."
    if os.system('jed +%d %s' % (linenum,filename)) != 0:
        raise ipapi.TryNext()

ip.set_hook('editor', calljed)

You can then enable the functionality by doing 'import myiphooks'
somewhere in your configuration files or ipython command line.
