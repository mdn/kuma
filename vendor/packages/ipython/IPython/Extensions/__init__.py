"""This directory is meant for special-purpose extensions to IPython.

This can include things which alter the syntax processing stage (see
PhysicalQ_Input for an example of how to do this).

Any file located here can be called with an 'execfile =' option as

  execfile = Extensions/filename.py

since the IPython directory itself is already part of the search path for
files listed as 'execfile ='.
