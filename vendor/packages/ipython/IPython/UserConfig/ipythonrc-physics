# If this file is found in the user's ~/.ipython directory as
# ipythonrc-physics, it can be loaded by calling passing the '-profile
# physics' (or '-p physics') option to IPython.

# This profile loads modules useful for doing interactive calculations with
# physical quantities (with units). It relies on modules from Konrad Hinsen's
# ScientificPython (http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/)

# First load basic user configuration
