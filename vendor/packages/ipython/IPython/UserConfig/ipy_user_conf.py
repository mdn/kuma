""" User configuration file for IPython

This is a more flexible and safe way to configure ipython than *rc files
(ipythonrc, ipythonrc-pysh etc.)

This file is always imported on ipython startup. You can import the
ipython extensions you need here (see IPython/Extensions directory).

Feel free to edit this file to customize your ipython experience.

Note that as such this file does nothing, for backwards compatibility.
Consult e.g. file 'ipy_profile_sh.py' for an example of the things 
you can do here.

See http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/IpythonExtensionApi for detailed
description on what you could do here.

    # Good idea e.g. for %edit os.path.isfile

    #import ipy_editors

    #ipy_editors.scite()
    #ipy_editors.scite('c:/opt/scite/scite.exe')
    #ipy_editors.komodo()
    #ipy_editors.idle()
    # ... or many others, try 'ipy_editors??' after import to see them
    
    # Or roll your own:
    #ipy_editors.install_editor("c:/opt/jed +$line $file")

    # A different, more compact set of prompts from the default ones, that
    # always show your current location in the filesystem:

    #import jobctrl

    #import ipy_autoreload
    
    # For winpdb support (%wdb)
    #import ipy_winpdb

    #ip.load('ipy_bzr')

    # at your own risk!
