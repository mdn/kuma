# This is an example of a 'profile' file which includes a base file and adds
# some customizaton for a particular purpose.

# If this file is found in the user's ~/.ipython directory as
# ipythonrc-numeric, it can be loaded by calling passing the '-profile
# numeric' (or '-p numeric') option to IPython.

# A simple alias numpy -> 'ipython -p numeric' makes life very convenient.

# This example is meant to load several modules to turn IPython into a very
# capable environment for high-end numerical work, similar to IDL or MatLab
# but with the beauty and flexibility of the Python language.

# Load the user's basic configuration
include ipythonrc

# import ...

# Load Numeric by itself so that 'help Numeric' works
import_mod Numeric

# from ... import *
# GnuplotRuntime loads Gnuplot and adds enhancements for use in IPython
import_all Numeric IPython.numutils IPython.GnuplotInteractive

# Below are optional things off by default. Uncomment them if desired.

# MA (MaskedArray) modifies the Numeric printing mechanism so that huge arrays
# are only summarized and not printed (which may freeze the machine for a
