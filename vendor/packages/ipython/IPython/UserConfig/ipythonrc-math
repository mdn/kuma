# Configuration file for ipython -- ipythonrc format

# The format of this file is one of 'key value' lines.
# Lines containing only whitespace at the beginning and then a # are ignored

# This is an example of a 'profile' file which includes a base file and adds
# some customizaton for a particular purpose.

# If this file is found in the user's ~/.ipython directory as ipythonrc-math,
# it can be loaded by calling passing the '-profile math' (or '-p math')
# option to IPython.

# This example is a light customization to have ipython have basic math functions
# readily available, effectively making the python prompt a very capable scientific
# calculator

# include base config and only add some extras
include ipythonrc

# load the complex math functions but keep them in a separate namespace
import_mod cmath

# from ... import *
# load the real math functions in the global namespace for convenience
import_all math

# from ... import ...
import_some

# code to execute
execute print "*** math functions available globally, cmath as a module"
