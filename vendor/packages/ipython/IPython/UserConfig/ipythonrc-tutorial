# If this file is found in the user's ~/.ipython directory as
# ipythonrc-tutorial, it can be loaded by calling passing the '-profile
# tutorial' (or '-p tutorial') option to IPython.

# This profile loads a special input line filter to allow typing lines which
# begin with '>>> ' or '... '. These two strings, if present at the start of
# the input line, are stripped. This allows for direct pasting of code from
# examples such as those available in the standard Python tutorial.

# First load basic user configuration
include ipythonrc

# import ...
# Module with alternate input syntax for pasting python input
import_mod IPython.Extensions.InterpreterPasteInput

# from ... import *
