        When scripts are executed via %run, we must keep a reference to the
        namespace of their __main__ module (a FakeModule instance) around so
        that Python doesn't clear it, rendering objects defined therein
        useless.

        This method keeps said reference in a private dict, keyed by the
        absolute path of the module object (which corresponds to the script
        path).  This way, for multiple executions of the same script we only
        keep one copy of the namespace (the last one), thus preventing memory
        leaks from old references while allowing the objects from the last
        execution to be accessible.

        Note: we can not allow the actual FakeModule instances to be deleted,
        because of how Python tears down modules (it hard-sets all their
        references to None without regard for reference counts).  This method

      GUI frameworks like wxPython trap exceptions and call

      enables them to keep running after exceptions that would
      otherwise kill their mainloop. This is a bother for IPython
      which excepts to catch all of the program exceptions with a try:
      except: statement.

      Normally, IPython sets sys.excepthook to a CrashHandler instance, so if
      any app directly invokes sys.excepthook, it will look to the user like
      IPython crashed.  In order to work around this, we can disable the
      CrashHandler and replace it with this excepthook instead, which prints a
      regular traceback using our InteractiveTB.  In this fashion, apps which
      call sys.excepthook will generate a regular-looking exception from
      IPython, and the CrashHandler will only be triggered by real IPython
      crashes.

      This hook should be used sparingly, only in places which are not likely
      to be true IPython errors.
