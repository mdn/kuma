SQLAlchemy
++++++++++

The Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper

Requirements
------------

SQLAlchemy requires Python 2.4 or higher.  One or more DB-API implementations
are also required for database access.  See docs/intro.html for more
information on supported DB-API implementations.

Python 3 Compatibility
----------------------

Please see README.py3k for Python 3 installation and testing instructions.

Installation Tools
------------------

Installation is supported with standard Python distutils, as well
as with setuptools or Distribute.  Distribute is recommended.
Distribute can be installed using the provided "distribute_setup.py" 
script.  The original setuptools may be installed using the 
"ez_setup.py" script if preferred, or simply do nothing and distutils
will be used.

Installing
----------

To install::

  python setup.py install

To use without installation, include the ``lib`` directory in your Python
path.

Installing the C extension
--------------------------

If installing with Setuptools or Distribute, the C extensions are built 
and installed using the --with-cextensions flag:

  python setup.py --with-cextensions install

If using plain Distutils, change the BUILD_CEXTENSIONS flag in setup.py
to "True".

Running Tests
-------------

Please see README.unittests for full instructions on running unit tests.
