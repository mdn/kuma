class PoolListener(object):
    """Hooks into the lifecycle of connections in a ``Pool``.

    Usage::
    
        class MyListener(PoolListener):
            def connect(self, dbapi_con, con_record):
                '''perform connect operations'''

    All of the standard connection :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.Pool` types can
    accept event listeners for key connection lifecycle events:
    creation, pool check-out and check-in.  There are no events fired
    when a connection closes.

    For any given DB-API connection, there will be one ``connect``
    event, `n` number of ``checkout`` events, and either `n` or `n - 1`
    ``checkin`` events.  (If a ``Connection`` is detached from its
    pool via the ``detach()`` method, it won't be checked back in.)

    These are low-level events for low-level objects: raw Python
    DB-API connections, without the conveniences of the SQLAlchemy
    ``Connection`` wrapper, ``Dialect`` services or ``ClauseElement``
    execution.  If you execute SQL through the connection, explicitly
    closing all cursors and other resources is recommended.

    Events also receive a ``_ConnectionRecord``, a long-lived internal
    ``Pool`` object that basically represents a "slot" in the
    connection pool.  ``_ConnectionRecord`` objects have one public
    attribute of note: ``info``, a dictionary whose contents are
    scoped to the lifetime of the DB-API connection managed by the
    record.  You can use this shared storage area however you like.

    There is no need to subclass ``PoolListener`` to handle events.
    Any class that implements one or more of these methods can be used
    as a pool listener.  The ``Pool`` will inspect the methods
    provided by a listener object and add the listener to one or more
    internal event queues based on its capabilities.  In terms of
    efficiency and function call overhead, you're much better off only
    providing implementations for the hooks you'll be using.

    Either or both of the ``execute()`` and ``cursor_execute()``

        class MyProxy(ConnectionProxy):

    The ``execute`` argument is a function that will fulfill the default
    execution behavior for the operation.  The signature illustrated
    in the example should be used.
    
    The proxy is installed into an :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Engine` via
    the ``proxy`` argument::
