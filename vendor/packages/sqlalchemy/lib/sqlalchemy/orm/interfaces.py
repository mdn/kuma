    New extension classes subclass ``MapperExtension`` and are specified
    using the ``extension`` mapper() argument, which is a single
    ``MapperExtension`` or a list of such.   A single mapper
    can maintain a chain of ``MapperExtension`` objects.  When a
    particular mapping event occurs, the corresponding method 
    on each ``MapperExtension`` is invoked serially, and each method
    has the ability to halt the chain from proceeding further.
    
    Each ``MapperExtension`` method returns the symbol
    EXT_CONTINUE by default.   This symbol generally means "move
    to the next ``MapperExtension`` for processing".  For methods
    that return objects like translated rows or new object
    instances, EXT_CONTINUE means the result of the method
    should be ignored.   In some cases it's required for a 
    default mapper activity to be performed, such as adding a 
    new instance to a result list.
    
    The symbol EXT_STOP has significance within a chain
    of ``MapperExtension`` objects that the chain will be stopped
    when this symbol is returned.  Like EXT_CONTINUE, it also
    has additional significance in some cases that a default
    mapper activity will not be performed.
