def sessionmaker(bind=None, class_=None, autoflush=True, autocommit=False,
                 expire_on_commit=True, **kwargs):
    """Generate a custom-configured :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` class.

    The returned object is a subclass of ``Session``, which, when instantiated
    with no arguments, uses the keyword arguments configured here as its
    constructor arguments.

    It is intended that the `sessionmaker()` function be called within the
    global scope of an application, and the returned class be made available
    to the rest of the application as the single class used to instantiate
    sessions.

    e.g.::

        # global scope
        Session = sessionmaker(autoflush=False)

        # later, in a local scope, create and use a session:
        sess = Session()

    Any keyword arguments sent to the constructor itself will override the
    "configured" keywords::

        Session = sessionmaker()

        # bind an individual session to a connection
        sess = Session(bind=connection)

    The class also includes a special classmethod ``configure()``, which
    allows additional configurational options to take place after the custom
    ``Session`` class has been generated.  This is useful particularly for
    defining the specific ``Engine`` (or engines) to which new instances of
    ``Session`` should be bound::

        Session = sessionmaker()
        Session.configure(bind=create_engine('sqlite:///foo.db'))

        sess = Session()

    Options:

    :param autocommit: Defaults to ``False``. When ``True``, the ``Session``
      does not keep a persistent transaction running, and will acquire
      connections from the engine on an as-needed basis, returning them
      immediately after their use. Flushes will begin and commit (or possibly
      rollback) their own transaction if no transaction is present. When using
      this mode, the `session.begin()` method may be used to begin a
      transaction explicitly.

      Leaving it on its default value of ``False`` means that the ``Session``
      will acquire a connection and begin a transaction the first time it is
      used, which it will maintain persistently until ``rollback()``,
      ``commit()``, or ``close()`` is called. When the transaction is released
      by any of these methods, the ``Session`` is ready for the next usage,
      which will again acquire and maintain a new connection/transaction.

    :param autoflush: When ``True``, all query operations will issue a 
       ``flush()`` call to this ``Session`` before proceeding. This is a
       convenience feature so that ``flush()`` need not be called repeatedly
       in order for database queries to retrieve results. It's typical that
       ``autoflush`` is used in conjunction with ``autocommit=False``. In this
       scenario, explicit calls to ``flush()`` are rarely needed; you usually
       only need to call ``commit()`` (which flushes) to finalize changes.

    :param bind: An optional ``Engine`` or ``Connection`` to which this
       ``Session`` should be bound. When specified, all SQL operations
       performed by this session will execute via this connectable.

    :param binds: An optional dictionary which contains more granular "bind"
       information than the ``bind`` parameter provides. This dictionary can
       map individual ``Table`` instances as well as ``Mapper`` instances to
       individual ``Engine`` or ``Connection`` objects. Operations which
       proceed relative to a particular ``Mapper`` will consult this
       dictionary for the direct ``Mapper`` instance as well as the mapper's
       ``mapped_table`` attribute in order to locate an connectable to use.
       The full resolution is described in the ``get_bind()`` method of
       ``Session``. Usage looks like::

        sess = Session(binds={
            SomeMappedClass: create_engine('postgresql://engine1'),
            somemapper: create_engine('postgresql://engine2'),
            some_table: create_engine('postgresql://engine3'),
            })

      Also see the ``bind_mapper()`` and ``bind_table()`` methods.

    :param \class_: Specify an alternate class other than
       ``sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session`` which should be used by the returned
       class. This is the only argument that is local to the
       ``sessionmaker()`` function, and is not sent directly to the
       constructor for ``Session``.

    :param _enable_transaction_accounting:  Defaults to ``True``.  A
       legacy-only flag which when ``False`` disables *all* 0.5-style object
       accounting on transaction boundaries, including auto-expiry of
       instances on rollback and commit, maintenance of the "new" and
       "deleted" lists upon rollback, and autoflush of pending changes upon
       begin(), all of which are interdependent.

    :param expire_on_commit:  Defaults to ``True``. When ``True``, all
       instances will be fully expired after each ``commit()``, so that all
       attribute/object access subsequent to a completed transaction will load
       from the most recent database state.

    :param extension: An optional 
       :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.SessionExtension` instance, or a list
       of such instances, which will receive pre- and post- commit and flush
       events, as well as a post-rollback event. User- defined code may be
       placed within these hooks using a user-defined subclass of
       ``SessionExtension``.

    :param query_cls:  Class which should be used to create new Query objects,
       as returned by the ``query()`` method. Defaults to
       :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query`.

    :param twophase:  When ``True``, all transactions will be started using
        :mod:`~sqlalchemy.engine_TwoPhaseTransaction`. During a ``commit()``,
        after ``flush()`` has been issued for all attached databases, the
        ``prepare()`` method on each database's ``TwoPhaseTransaction`` will
        be called. This allows each database to roll back the entire
        transaction, before each transaction is committed.

    :param weak_identity_map:  When set to the default value of ``True``, a
       weak-referencing map is used; instances which are not externally
       referenced will be garbage collected immediately. For dereferenced
       instances which have pending changes present, the attribute management
       system will create a temporary strong-reference to the object which
       lasts until the changes are flushed to the database, at which point
       it's again dereferenced. Alternatively, when using the value ``False``,
       the identity map uses a regular Python dictionary to store instances.
       The session will maintain all instances present until they are removed
       using expunge(), clear(), or purge().

        there is no net change to the attribute's value.  At flush
        time, the value of each attribute is compared to its
        previously saved value, and if there's no net change, no SQL
        operation will occur (this is a more expensive operation so
        it's only done at flush time).

        To check if an instance has actionable net changes to its
        attributes, use the is_modified() method.
