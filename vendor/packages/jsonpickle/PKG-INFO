Description: Python library for serializing any arbitrary object graph into JSON.
        It can take almost any Python object and turn the object into JSON.
        Additionally, it can reconstitute the object back into Python.
        
        >>> import jsonpickle
        >>> from samples import Thing
        
        Create an object.
        
        >>> obj = Thing('A String')
        >>> print obj.name
        A String
        
        Use jsonpickle to transform the object into a JSON string.
        
        >>> pickled = jsonpickle.encode(obj)
        >>> print pickled
        {"py/object": "samples.Thing", "name": "A String", "child": null}
        
        Use jsonpickle to recreate a Python object from a JSON string
        
        >>> unpickled = jsonpickle.decode(pickled)
        >>> str(unpickled.name)
        'A String'
        
        .. warning::
        
        Loading a JSON string from an untrusted source represents a potential
        security vulnerability.  jsonpickle makes no attempt to sanitize the input.
        
        The new object has the same type and data, but essentially is now a copy of
        the original.
        
        >>> obj == unpickled
        False
        >>> obj.name == unpickled.name
        True
        >>> type(obj) == type(unpickled)
        True
        
        If you will never need to load (regenerate the Python class from JSON), you can
        pass in the keyword unpicklable=False to prevent extra information from being
        added to JSON.
        
        >>> oneway = jsonpickle.encode(obj, unpicklable=False)
        >>> print oneway
        {"name": "A String", "child": null}
