Thanks for downloading django_threadedcomments!

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

If you'd prefer, you can simply place the included ``threadedcomments``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on your
Python path; this is useful if you're working from a Subversion checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and Django later than
0.96. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django from 
http://www.djangoproject.com/.
