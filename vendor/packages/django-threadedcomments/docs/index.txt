Django-threadedcomments is a simple yet flexible threaded commenting system for 
Django. What it means to say that they are *threaded* is that commenters can 
reply not only to the original item, but to other comments as well. It becomes
near-trivial to create a system similar to what Reddit or Digg have in their 
comments sections.
