Description: Mock is a flexible mock object intended to replace the use of stubs and test doubles
        throughout your code. Mocks are callable and create attributes as new mocks when you
        access them. Accessing the same attribute will always return the same mock. Mocks
        record how you use them, allowing you to make assertions about what your code has
        done to them.
