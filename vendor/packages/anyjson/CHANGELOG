0.1:

 * Initial release

0.1.1

 * Added benchmarking script
 * Added support for more serializer modules

0.2

 * Added exception handling so that all supported modules will result in the
   same exceptions being thrown. The exceptions are the same that are used
   by the JSON module from python 2.7, TypeError for serialize and
   ValueError for deserialize.
 * '''NOTE''' API changed. the implementation property is now an object, not
   a string
 * Rewrote module loading code, so it's now easier to add and rearrange
   JSON modules

0.2.1

 * Fixed bug that rendered the lib uninstalleable with easy_install if there
   was no supported json module allready installed

0.2.2

 * Fixed bug #2. Installation failed if there were noe compatible json
   implementations installed, because the module was loaeded, and threw import
   exception during the install process.

0.2.3

 * Fixed bug #3
 * Fixed bug in benchmarking script

0.2.4

 * Added support for py-yajl (Thanks Benjamin Anderson)
 * Improved benchmark script to test serialization performance and
   to use real life data for tests.

0.2.5

 * Added loads and dumps methods so anyjson can be used interchangably
   with the stdlib json module. Note: The original methods are still
   in place. Nothing from the 0.2.4 API is changed, removed or deprecated
   in this release.

0.3

 * Added support for python3

0.3.1

 * Added deprecation warning for cjson and made it the least preferred
   implementation. See: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-cjson/1.0.5
