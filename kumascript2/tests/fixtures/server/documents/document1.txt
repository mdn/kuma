Here is \{{ some more text \}} with double braces, but not a macro.
But, we should also \\{ be able to use \ backslashes \\wherever \\\we like.
Here is { some text } with braces, but not a macro.

* {{t1}}
* {{ t2(12, 12) }}
* {{ t3(1) }}
* This should be not found, and handled gracefully: {{ y4 }}

Look, it's JSON without escaping: {{ json_unescaped('a', 'b', 'c') }}

Here is a macro with a JSON parameter: {{ json_unescaped({
    "alpha": "one", "beta": "two", "gamma": "three"
}) }}

Here is a multi-line macro: {{ json(
  "With many", 'parameters',
  'including "quoted"', "text of both 'kinds'",
  "even \"escaped\"", 'like \'these\'',
  "and numbers", -10, 0, 0.1, 10, 100
)}} that even works inline.

Here is another macro with a JSON parameter: {{ json_unescaped({
    "alpha": "uno", "beta": "dos", "gamma": "tres"
}) }}
