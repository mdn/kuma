Here is { some text } with braces, but not a macro.
This is {{ OneInline }} macro and {{Another()}} macro.
The following items are all macros, though:

* {{ MacroUsingParams("Foo", "Bar", "Baz") }}
* {{HéllöWôrld("Unicode!")}}
* {{ 頁尾附註 ( "下一頁", "カタカナ", "BLAH" ) }}
* {{ Alpha_Macro_123 ( "Quoted, Comma", 'Another, quoted' ) }}
* {{ ParenTastic ( "()()()" ) }}
* {{ Bracepocalypse(  "{{}}{{}}{{}}"  ) }}

Here is a {{ MultiLineMacro(
  "With many", 'parameters',
  'including "quoted"', "text of both 'kinds'",
  "even \"escaped\"", 'like \'these\'',
  "and numbers", -10, 0, 0.1, 10, 100
)}} that even works inline.

Here is a {{ MacroWithJson({
    "es":"es/JavaScript/Acerca_de_JavaScript",
    "en": "en/JavaScript/About_JavaScript"
}) }} that even works inline.
