The following items are all macros, though:

* ["Foo","Bar","Baz"]
* ["HéllöWôrld"]
* ["下一頁","カタカナ","BLAH"]
* ["Quoted, Comma","Another, quoted"]
* ["()()()"]
* ["{{}}{{}}{{}}"]

Here is a ["With many","parameters","including \"quoted\"","text of both 'kinds'","even \"escaped\"","like 'these'","and numbers","-10","0","0.1","10","100"] that even works inline.

Here is a [{"es":"es/JavaScript/Acerca_de_JavaScript","en":"en/JavaScript/About_JavaScript"}] that even works inline.
