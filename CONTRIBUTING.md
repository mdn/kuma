Contributing Code
=================

  * You agree to license your contributions under [MPL 2][MPL2]
  * Discuss large changes on the [dev-mdn mailing list][dev-mdn]
    or on a [bugzilla bug][mdn-backlog] before coding.
  * Python code style should follow [PEP8 standards][pep8] whenever possible.
  * All commit messages must start with "bug NNNNNNN" or "fix bug NNNNNNN"
    * Reason: Make it easy for someone to consume the commit log and reach originating requests for all changes
    * Exceptions: "Merge" and "Revert" commits
    * Notes:
      * "fix bug NNNNNNN" - will trigger a github bot to automatically mark bug as "RESOLVED:FIXED"
      * If a pull request has multiple commits, we should squash commits together or re-word commit messages so that each commit message contains a bug number

  * MDN module [owner or peer][peers] must review and merge all pull requests.
    * Reason: Owner and peers are and accountable for the quality of MDN code changes
    * Exceptions: Owners/peers may commit directly to master for critical security/down-time fixes; they must file a bug for follow-up review.

  * Pull requests that contain changes to database migrations or any other code changes
    that modify the database layout MUST have been reviewed at least by two
    [peers][peers], one of which MUST be a module owner.
    * Reason: Changes to database tables are critical and may lead to loss of data.
    * Exceptions: None.
    * Notes: A great way to get a 2nd review is to explain the migration to someone who wasn't involved in its development or 1st review.

  * MDN reviewers must verify sufficient test coverage on all changes - either by new or existing tests
    * Reason: Automated tests reduce human error involved in reviews
    * Notes: The Django site has [good testing docs][django-testing]

How to submit code
==================

GitHub workflow
---------------

   1. [Install our development environment](http://kuma.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation-vagrant.html)
   2. Set up mozilla remote ($ git remote add mozilla git://github.com/mozilla/kuma.git)
   3. Create a branch for a bug ($ git checkout -b new-issue-888888)
   4. Develop on bug branch.

   [Time passes, the mozilla/kuma repository accumulates new commits]
   5. Commit changes to bug branch ($ git add . ; git commit -m 'fix bug 888888 - commit message')
   6. Fetch mozilla ($ git fetch mozilla)
   7. Update local master ($ git checkout master; git pull mozilla master)

   Repeat steps 4-7 till dev is complete

   8. Rebase issue branch ($ git checkout new-issue-888888; git rebase master)
   9. Push branch to GitHub ($ git push origin new-issue-888888)
   10. Issue pull request (Click Pull Request button)
