Kuma in VirtualBox via Vagrant
==============================

The core developers run Kuma in a `Vagrant`_-managed virtual machine to
simplify `installation <installation.rst>`_.
If you're on Mac OS X or Linux and looking for a quick way to get started, you
should try these instructions.

This could possibly be made to work under Windows, but few have
tried. Bug reports and suggestions are welcome.
The main barrier to Windows is that this Vagrantfile `uses NFS to share
the current working directory`_ for performance reasons, and also Vagrant
support for Windows is not-so-great yet.

Getting up and running
----------------------

-  Install VirtualBox 4 from http://www.virtualbox.org/
-  Install vagrant using ``gem`` from a Terminal window, or by downloading
   a package from `vagrantup.com`_. ::

       gem update
       gem install vagrant

.. _vagrantup.com: http://vagrantup.com/
-  To follow the instructions from `Webdev Bootcamp <http://mozweb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/git.html#working-on-projects>`_,
   fork the project into your own account.
-  Clone your fork of Kuma and update submodules (**don't** try to use the same working
   directory as for the local installation)::

       git clone git://github.com/<your_account>/kuma.git
       cd kuma
       git submodule update --init --recursive

-  Create a ``vagrantconfig_local.yaml`` file to configure your VM::

       cp vagrantconfig_local.yaml-dist vagrantconfig_local.yaml

   This may have some interesting settings for you to tweak, but the
   defaults should work fine.

-  The next step is to fire up the VM and install everything.
   By default, VirtualBox creates VMs in your system drive and kuma's VM weighs 3GB;
   so you might need to change that directory to another drive following `that tutorial <http://emptysquare.net/blog/moving-virtualbox-and-vagrant-to-an-external-drive/>`_.
   When you are ready, use the following command and go take a bike ride (approx.
   30 min on a fast net connection).::

       vagrant up

-  If the above process fails with an error, try running the Puppet setup
   again with the following command::

       vagrant provision

   This often recovers from transient network issues or installation
   ordering problems. However, In some rare occasions you might need
   to run this multiple times

-  On Ubuntu, "vagrant up" will likely fail after being unable to mount NFS shared folders.
   The solution is to disable nfs by setting the nfs flag in the vagrantconfig_local.yaml file you just created.

       nfs: false

   The system will be a lot slower.

-  Add developer-dev.mozilla.org to /etc/hosts::

       echo '192.168.10.55 developer-local.allizom.org' >> /etc/hosts

-  Everything should be working now, from the host side::

       curl 'https://developer-local.allizom.org'

-  You should be able to log into a shell in the VM as the user
   ``vagrant``::

       vagrant ssh

What’s next?
------------

-  See `development <development.rst>`_ for tips not specific to vagrant.

-  Django and node.js web services must be started within the VM by
   hand, which makes them easier to restart during development. Details
   on this should be displayed via ``/etc/motd`` when you log in with
   ``vagrant ssh``

-  Edit files as usual on your host machine; the current directory is
   mounted via NFS at /vagrant within the VM. Update should be reflected
   without any action on your part.

-  Useful vagrant sub-commands::

       vagrant ssh     # Connect to the VM via ssh
       vagrant suspend # Sleep the VM, saving state
       vagrant halt    # Shutdown the VM
       vagrant up      # Boot up the VM
       vagrant destroy # Destroy the VM

-  You should occasionally re-run the Puppet setup, especially after
   updating code with major changes. This will ensure that the VM
   environment stays up to date with configuration changes and
   installation of additional services.

   -  On the Host::

          vagrant provision

   -  Inside the VM::

          sudo puppet apply /vagrant/puppet/manifests/dev-vagrant.pp

-  The VM comes with MindTouch wiki (the one that powers the production
   developer.mozilla.org site) installed. Visit http://developer-dev.mozilla.org/en/Test
   after you log in to create a page in it.

-  **Experimental and Optional**: Download and import data extracted and
   sanitized from the production site. This can take a long while, since
   there’s over 500MB of data to download. ::

       vagrant ssh
       sudo puppet apply /vagrant/puppet/manifests/dev-vagrant-mdn-import.pp
       sudo puppet apply /vagrant/puppet/manifests/dev-vagrant.pp

-  After your first sign in, SSH into the vagrant box and add yourself as an admin:

       vagrant ssh
       mysql -uroot kuma
       UPDATE auth_user set is_staff = 1, is_active=1, is_superuser = 1 WHERE username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'

- Alternatively, you can simply issue the command:

       ./manage.py createsuperuser

-  To allow creation and editing of documents, go to /admin/, go to the waffle section and add flags called ``kumaediting`` and ``kumawiki``
