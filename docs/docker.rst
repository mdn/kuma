Docker Images
=============
Docker images are used in development, usually with the local
working files mounted in the images to set behaviour.

Images are built by Jenkins__, after tests pass, and are
published to DockerHub__.  We try to
`store the configuration in the environment`_, so that the
published images can be used in deployments by setting
environment variables to deployment-specific values.
