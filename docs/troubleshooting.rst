Troubleshooting
===============

Kuma has many components. Even core developers need reminders of how to keep
them all working together. This doc outlines some problems and potential
solutions running Kuma.

Kuma "Reset"
------------

We have a script that attempts to fix some of the most common problems with
Kuma that are described below::

  pushd .
  # open https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckIMuvumYrg
  cd /path/to/kuma
  vagrant halt
  make clean
  git submodule sync --recursive && git submodule update --init --recursive
  vagrant up && vagrant provision
  popd

.. _Running individual processes:

Running individual processes
----------------------------

It is usually easier to see and debug problems if you run MDN processes
individually, instead of running them via ``foreman``. You can run each process
exactly as it is listed in ``Procfile``

-  ``runserver`` - runs the Django development server

-  ``celery worker`` - runs the celery worker process for tasks

-  ``celerycam`` - stores a snapshot of celery tasks to display in admin site

-  ``kumascript`` - runs the node.js process for KumaScript macros

-  ``stylus`` - runs a process to compile all ``.styl`` changes into ``.css``


Errors after switching branches
-------------------------------

-  You should occasionally re-run the VM setup, especially after updating
   code with major changes. This will ensure that the VM environment stays
   up to date with configuration changes and installation of additional
   services.

   On the Host run::

       vagrant provision

-  If you see ``ImportError:`` errors, you may need to update your git
   submodules and/or clean out your ``*.pyc`` files to make sure python has all
   the latest files it needs.::

       git submodule update --init
       find . -name "*.pyc" | xargs rm -f

-  If you see ``DatabaseError: (1146, "Table '...' doesn't exist")`` errors,
   you probably need to run database migrations.::

       python manage.py migrate

   Note: If you are using a VM, this is done when you re-run the Puppet setup.


Errors with KumaScript
----------------------

KumaScript is a very intensive process. If you are only working on python code
or front-end code that doesn't affect live site content, you can usually avoid
running it. (See `Running individual processes`_.)

-  If you see lots of KumaScript timeout errors and you're running a VM, try
   increasing the memory allocated to the VM.

   Update the ``.env`` file in the ``/home/vagrant/src`` folder::

       MEMORY_SIZE=4096

-  If you see ``Kumascript service failed unexpectedly: HTTPConnectionPool``,
   make sure you enabled :ref:`KumaScript <enable KumaScript>`.
