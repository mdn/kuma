Minors 13 years or older who reside in the U.S. and minors in certain other countries, depending on local laws, are also eligible to participate in the Contest but will be required to submit a signed parental consent form.

    <h3>How to Enter</h3>
    <p> To enter, visit the Mozilla Dev Derby, located at https://developer.mozilla.org/demos/devderby (the “Dev Derby page”), review the contest information, create an account, and follow the instructions to submit your demo (“Entry”). As part of the account registration process you will be required to accept the Terms for Demo Contributors, which specify that the creative elements and source code of your Entry will be licensed under open licenses, among other things. Your Entry must comply with the requirements described for all demos and specifically for Entries to this Contest. Your Entry must be uploaded in one of the identified formats before the end of the Submission Period. You may submit as many Entries as you want.</p>
    
    <p>You must be the named and authorized account holder of the email address submitted in connection with your Entry. The authorized account holder is the natural person who is assigned to the email address by an internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization that is responsible for assigning email addresses or the domain associated with the submitted email address. Entries submitted will not be returned or acknowledged.</p>
    
    <p>Without limiting any other rights, the Sponsor has the right to, in the Sponsor's sole discretion, reject or remove from the Contest any Entry that, in the Sponsor's sole discretion, violates these Rules, any applicable Sponsor policy, any applicable laws, or is in any way harmful or objectionable. Sponsor also reserves the right to disqualify any entrant or Entry at the Sponsor's sole discretion. No correspondence shall be entered into.</p>
    
    <h3>Privacy</h3> 
    <p>Through your account registration you will provide us with your email address. We won’t request any other personal information from entrants. We will ask potential winners for their names and addresses so we can send the prize. All Entries and the information provided by entrants with their entries will be publicly available on the demo site and may be posted to other sites as well. Except as otherwise stated herein or as otherwise agreed by you and the Sponsor, all other personal information you provide in connection with the Contest will be used only for purposes relating to this Contest, and will not be communicated to third-parties without prior permission or as otherwise specified in our Privacy Policy located at http://www.mozilla.org/privacy-policy.html.</p>

    <p> A new Contest begins each month at 12:00:01 a.m. PT on the first day of the month, and ends at 11:59:59 p.m. PT on the last day of that month (“Contest Period”). Each day/date is calculated based on Pacific Time. Each month’s Contest is separate, however, if you would like an Entry you submitted in a prior month considered for a new Contest with a different challenge topic, just send us an email to speters at mozilla dot com. Entries may not be resubmitted for a subsequent contest on the same challenge topic. The winner of each month’s Contest will be announced by the 20th of the following month. Contests will be run for an indefinite number of months at Sponsor’s sole discretion. Sponsor will provide notice prior to the beginning of the final Contest.</p>
