                You can support MDN with a one-time payment, or you can choose to schedule monthly payments. Your payments are not tax deductible.
                In order to sign up for monthly payments, you must sign in to MDN using a GitHub account.
                GitHub has its own <a href="{{ terms_url }}">Terms</a> and <a href="{{ privacy_policy_url }}">Privacy Policy</a>.
                When you choose to support MDN, you authorize us to charge the payment card you provide for the amount you choose, either as a one-time payment, or as a recurring monthly payment.

                <a href="mailto:mdn-support@mozilla.com">mdn-support@mozilla.com</a>.
                If you choose to cancel, we will not charge your payment card for subsequent months.

                Mozilla receives a record of your payment and information about how much you’ve decided to
                pay and whether you’ve set up monthly payments. Mozilla does not receive your payment details.
                If you sign up for an MDN account, Mozilla also receives information about your account.
                When Mozilla receives information from you, our <a href="{{ privacy_url }}">Mozilla Privacy Policy</a> describes how we handle that information.
