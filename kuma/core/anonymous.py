"""
Django middleware for identifying unauthenticated users using a cookie.
This is used in kuma to keep track of their actions such as voting and
submitting questions.

The middleware adds an `anonymous` attribute to the request object. It is
initialized to the value of the anonymous id cookie, if set.

The anonymous id will be generated automatically when
`request.anonymous.attribute_id` is first accessed. In order to check if
it is set without generating one, use `request.anonymous.has_id`. Once the
anonymous id is generated, it will be set in a cookie in the response.


Required Settings:

ANONYMOUS_COOKIE_NAME
Name of the cookie to use

ANONYMOUS_COOKIE_MAX_AGE
Maximum age of the cookie, in seconds.
