/**
 * The Router component defined in this file manages client side
 * navigation within the single-page app portions of MDN. Use the
 * Router with an array of Route objects that describe the kinds of
 * pages (for example document pages and search results pages) that
 * the router should handle.
 *
 * The Router will intercept clicks on links and form submissions
 * and if they are directed at URLs described by one of the routes, then
 * the Router will handle that navigation on the client side, using
 * methods of the Route object to parse the URL, fetch page data, and
 * get the page title and so on.
 *
 * The Router component also handles features related to client-side
 * navigation: it displays a loading animation, and submits data to
 * Google analytics.

     * This is the main routing function. Pass it a url and it returns

     * for example) that the user's click on a link cannot be handled on
     * the client side and that they need to let the browser handle it
     * via regular page load.
     *
     * If this function returns true, it means one of these things:
     *
     * 1) The specified URL is already displayed; no action is required
     *
     * 2) We have a route that can handle this url, we've called
     *    setPageState() and a re-render of the page is already
     *    pending.
     *
     * 3) We have a route that can handle this url. We're fetching
     *    data needed by the new page, but when that data arrives,
     *    we'll call setPageState() to rerender the page.
     *
     * In any of these cases, the return value of true means that the
     * url will be handled via client-side navigation and no further
     * action on the caller's part is required, except to call
     * preventDefault() on an event object to prevent the browser from
     * following a link or submitting a form.
     *
     * Normally this function is called with just one url argument.
     * But on the first call, if the initialData Router prop is set
     * we pass that value as the second argument so that we don't
     * need to make an asynchronous fetch. This second data argument
     * is important for server-side rendering.
