Kuma requirements
=================

Kuma uses `Poetry`_ for dependency management. Poetry is configured in the
``pyproject.toml`` file at the root of the repository.

We also supply a ``docs.txt`` file listing the requirements for building
documentation hosted at `Read the Docs`_.

.. _Poetry: https://poetry.eustace.io/
.. _Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.org
